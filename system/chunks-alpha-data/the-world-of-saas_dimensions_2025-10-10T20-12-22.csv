"target_answer","The_Saas_Marketing_Handbook-Final - the-world-of-saas - 10/10/2025, 12:58:47 PM","Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) is a delivery model where software is provided to customers over the Internet, eliminating the need for customers to install and maintain software on their own hardware servers.

This model creates two major advantages: First, it removes technical and budgeting barriers—customers can test and purchase software directly without lengthy hardware procurement or complex configuration. Second, the subscription-based pricing enables rapid growth as existing customers renew and new customers are acquired.

For marketing departments, SaaS fundamentally shifts responsibilities. Marketing now owns much more of the buying cycle because modern buyers research products and often try them out before ever speaking to sales. Most buyers expect transparent pricing on your website.

This shift means SaaS marketers must be intensely metrics-focused. CEOs now look to both the VP of Sales and VP of Marketing for business growth forecasting—the old sales/marketing blame game no longer works. SaaS is fundamentally a numbers game, requiring marketers to be more data-oriented than ever before.

The key takeaway: SaaS puts the buyer in control earlier in the journey, which means marketing must step up with strategy, content, and measurable results that drive predictable growth.","AI Generated","10.0","10.0","Ideal answer (concise, brand-aligned).","string",""
