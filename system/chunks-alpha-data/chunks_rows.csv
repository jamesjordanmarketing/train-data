Suspend disbelief. 
Act as if your success is certain. 
Instead  of  holding  back  because  you  don’t  have 
hard proof that you can make a quantum leap, see if 
you  end  up  with  evidence  proving  you can’t.  Just 
make the jump—act as if your success is guaranteed—

but habitual thinking. Years ago you accepted flawed 
conclusions  as  correct,  began  to  live  your  life  as if

3. Return to growth 
The  brand  is  out  of  step  with  the  times,  the  competition  has  changed  the  playing  field,  
sales are in decline, margins are weak, and people are losing interest in what the brand has 
to offer. Time to find a way to revive the brand. The strategy must be to fix the basics of 
the business, redress product issues, and then publicize what has been done to give new 
and  past  customers  a  reason  to  reconsider  their  brand  choice.  New,  more  sustainable,  
product formulations and packaging, may be part of the solution. 
 
Sustainability can be integral to all three of these strategies, but remember, it depends on whether 
you can make the end-consumer care enough to change their buying behavior.  
 
CREATE A BRAND POSITIONING 
Ultimately, brands provide a solution to people’s needs, want, and desires. Brands must solve the 
need for which people buy them, i.e., brands offer a functional benefit. But particularly when there 
are  multiple  brands  that  might  meet  someone’s  needs,  brands  must  address  more  emotional  
needs, i.e., brands offer an emotional benefit. The balance of importance of function and emotion 
will vary by brand and category, but the strongest brands  offer both. 
 
Given the competitive nature of most product categories, marketers focus on how their brand can 
gain  competitive  advantage  versus  the  competition.  The  key  question  is  why  might  someone

FAILURE TO INNOVATE IS A SUBSTANTIAL RISK TO BRAND VALUE 
 
 
As yet, sustainability has not created substantial brand risk (as opposed to business risk) but with 
sustainability growing in importance to consumers so too does the risk of not being seen to do the 
right  thing.  Many  large  companies  have  sought  to  mitigate  that risk  by  buying  small,  more

○ 
Low Competition: Focus on keywords with a low Keyword Difficulty (KD) score, 
ideally below 30 in tools like Ahrefs or Semrush.
42
 This indicates a higher probability 
of ranking with a new website. 
 

Building Topical Authority with Content Clusters 
 
Ranking for individual long-tail keywords is only part of the battle. To be recognized by search 
engines like Google as a true authority on a subject, a website must demonstrate 
comprehensive expertise. This is achieved by organizing content into ""topic clusters"" using a 
hub-and-spoke model.
36
 This structure not only pleases search engines but also creates a 
better, more organized user experience. 
● 
The Pillar Page (The Hub): This is the centerpiece of the cluster. It is a long-form, 
comprehensive piece of content (often 2,000 words or more) that provides a broad 
overview of a core topic. It should be one of the main subjects the brand wants to be 
known for. For example, a pillar page could be titled ""The Complete Guide to AI Data 
Privacy for Small Businesses"".
36
 This page should be broken down into clear subtopics, 
each of which will be explored in more detail in the cluster content. 
● 
The Cluster Content (The Spokes): These are shorter, more specific articles that each 
dive deep into one of the subtopics mentioned on the pillar page. They are designed to 
rank for the long-tail keywords discovered during the research phase. Following the 
example above, cluster content could include articles like: 
○ 
""How to choose a GDPR-compliant AI vendor"" 
○ 
""On-premise vs. cloud AI: a security comparison"" 
○ 
""Best practices for anonymizing data before AI training"" 
● 
The Power of Internal Linking: The magic of the topic cluster model lies in its internal 
linking structure. Each piece of cluster content (a spoke) must link back to the main pillar 
page (the hub). The pillar page, in turn, should link out to all of its corresponding cluster 
pages. Additionally, related cluster pages should link to each other where relevant.
36
 This 
creates a dense, logically organized web of content around a central theme. This 
structure signals to search engines that the website has a deep and interconnected body 
of knowledge on the topic, thereby establishing topical authority and boosting the 
rankings of all pages within the cluster.
36 
By combining a sharp focus on high-intent, low-competition long-tail keywords with the 
strategic organization of topic clusters, even a brand-new AI SaaS MVP can begin to carve out 
a defensible niche in organic search, attracting the right audience without spending a dime on 
ads. 
 
Chapter 6: The Build-in-Public Flywheel: From Transparency to Trust 
 
In the modern startup landscape, the traditional model of building in stealth, perfecting a 
product behind closed doors, and then revealing it to the world in a ""big bang"" launch is 

becoming increasingly obsolete. A more powerful, community-centric approach has emerged: 
building in public (BiP). This strategy involves openly and consistently sharing the startup's 
journey—from ideation and development to metrics and failures—with an audience in

 This approach secures early revenue, gathers 
critical product feedback, and generates the social proof (case studies, testimonials) 
needed to accelerate future sales. 
2. 
Value-Based Pricing: This strategy is best suited for products that deliver a clear, 
measurable Return on Investment (ROI) or cost savings. Instead of basing the price on 
development costs or competitor pricing, it is anchored to the economic value the 

solution provides to the customer. The price is set as a percentage of the value 
created—for example, a procurement optimization tool might charge 20% of the 
documented savings it generates for a client.
7
 For an MVP, this can be a powerful way to 
justify the price, as it directly aligns the product's cost with its success. It requires deep 
customer research to quantify the value, but when the ROI is clear, it allows for premium 
pricing even with a limited feature set. 
3. 
Incremental Value Pricing: This model is ideal for products with a clear and transparent 
public roadmap. The initial price is set low to reflect the MVP's limited feature set, 
rewarding early adopters for their faith in the product's vision. However, the company 
communicates transparently that the price will increase as new features and capabilities 
are added. According to research from ProfitWell, companies that implement this 
strategy see an average revenue increase of 22% during their early evolution phases.
7
 
This approach builds loyalty by making early customers feel smart for getting in on the 
ground floor, while setting a clear expectation of rising value and price over time. 
4. 
Free With a Clear Conversion Path: This strategy involves offering a core set of 
features for free, with more advanced functionality, higher usage limits, or premium 
support reserved for paying customers. Slack is a classic example, offering a generous 
free tier with a clear upgrade path once a team's needs grow.
7
 This model can be 
effective for products that benefit from network effects or require mass adoption to 
demonstrate their full value. However, for a bootstrapped MVP, it carries the risk of 
attracting a large number of free users who never convert, straining resources without 
providing revenue validation. If this path is chosen, the conversion path must be 
exceptionally clear and compelling. 
5. 
Freemium-to-Premium Migration: This is a longer-term strategy that involves offering 
the initial version of the product completely free to maximize user acquisition and build a 
large user base. Monetization is introduced only after achieving significant usage metrics 
and establishing strong product-market fit. Evernote famously used this model for years.
7
 
While powerful for venture-backed startups focused on rapid growth, this approach is 
generally not recommended for a shoestring MVP that needs to validate its business 
model and generate revenue early on. 
 
The ""Early Adopter"" Landing Page 
 
The pre-launch landing page is more than just a tool for collecting email addresses; it is a 
critical positioning asset that sets the tone for the entire launch. A poorly framed landing 
page can inadvertently position the product as a free beta, while a well-crafted one can build 
a queue of eager, high-quality potential customers. 
The language used is paramount. The call to action should not be ""Sign up for our beta."" 
Instead, it should be ""Apply for the Pilot Program,"" ""Request Early Access,"" or ""Join the 

Founding Members."" This subtle shift in wording transforms the proposition from a request for 
help into an offer of exclusivity.
8 
A strategic waitlist does more than just validate demand; it helps refine the product and build 
momentum. The key is to attract users who genuinely need the solution, not just a massive list 
of passive, curious onlookers.
8
 To achieve this, the landing page should offer compelling 
reasons to join, such as 
8
: 
● 
Exclusive Community Access: Granting waitlist members access to a private Discord or 
Slack community where they can interact directly with the founding team. 
● 
Special Pricing or Perks: Offering lifetime discounts or free access to future premium 
features. 
● 
Recognition and Influence: Highlighting the opportunity for early adopters to shape the 
product's future and see their feedback implemented. 
By curating the waitlist in this way, the founder is not just building an email list; they are 
building the foundation of a loyal community and identifying the power users who will become 
the product's first evangelists.
8 
 
Communicating Value to Justify the Cost 
 
Once a pricing model is chosen, it must be supported by consistent and compelling 
messaging across all marketing materials. The price is a direct reflection of the product's 
perceived value, and every touchpoint must work to reinforce that value. 
The core principle is to focus on the outcome, not the technology.

An example of one MVP was a student evaluation platform to
administer high stake formative and summative examinations to students.
The university researchers, including two authors of this paper, were given full access
to the ERC and were embedded in the day-to-day activities of the innovation team for
a period of six months. During this time the frameworks emerged in tandem with the
adaptation of the Lean Start-up approach within the ERC. For instance, the student
evaluation platform was released as an MVP to a number of pilot sites (e.g. a private
education entity, a local university, a training unit in a global pharmaceutical company).
In addition, focus groups were held students, lecturers, administration and management
staff, as well as those participating in the pilots. During the focus groups, participants
interacted with the MVP and were presented with a number of questions. After the focus
groups, the pilot sites continued to use the MVPs and they provided daily feedback.
Online usability testing of the MVP was also organised. The insights from these activities
informed the evolution of the framework and process map presented in this paper.

2. Background to Texuna
Founded in London in 2000, Texuna has offices located in the UK, Ireland and Russia.
Texuna has a strong reputation for designing scalable and secure data platforms that
adhere to international standards (e.g. ISO 27,001 for Information Security, ISO9001
for Quality Management, and ISO2000 for IT service management). Its client base
includes both public and private sector clients from a range of industries and it
supports in excess of 70,000 end-users dispersed across a large geographical area.
In 2012 the company collaborated with University College Cork (Ireland) in establish-
ing an Edtech Research Centre (ERC) for the purpose of investigating opportunities
for future products and services using customer-centric design methods. The ERC was
co-located with the company’s Shared Services Centre. The CEO sought to explore
new approaches that would enable the company to be more effective in bringing
product ideas forward to successful product launches. The research team recom-
mended the Lean Start-up approach to support the development of MVPs as the
existing software development method (Scrum) was not supporting the team to
develop multiple MVPs concurrently.
In itsfirst year of operation, the ERC adopted a Lean Start-up approach to successfully

themselves by the quality of their outputs. Employees were therefore keen to perfect those
outputs before handing them over to pilot sites. In addition, MVPs were deemed by team
members to have been a‘failure’when they were less well-received by pilot sites even
though many insightful lessons may have been learned from their release. The natural
instinct was, therefore, for the MVPs to be seen as outputs rather than a means for learning–
the focus thereby gradually creeping away from learning towards quality.
The early release of MVPs contributed, at times, to low morale within the team.
The teams felt they were releasing low-quality outputs that had not been fully
developed or fully tested. The DRI had to consistently challenge this mindset and
in some cases, he decided to release MVPs to pilot sites (even when he himself had
some concerns about their quality) as he wished‘to send out a message to his own
team of the need for early customer involvement’.

2  THE SAAS MARKETING HANDBOOK / TIM MATTHEWS
A  successful  SaaS  business  reaches  the  nirvana  that  I  call  the  
SaaS  ramp.  With  good  execution,  the  majority  of  your  customers  
renewing every year, and the same sales force and marketing budget, 
you should be able to double revenue (all of  last year plus the same 
for this year), with your revenue line looking like a nice steep ramp. 
Improve your marketing and sales force growth and you can increase 
the slope and make it even steeper.
The  strategies  described  here  are  not  limited  to  SaaS;  they  apply  
to  any  subscription  business.  Marketers  promoting  a  platform  or  
infrastructure  as  a  service  (IaaS  and  PaaS,  respectively)  can  make  
use  of  the  techniques  described  in  this  eBook—likewise  for  those  
who sell cloud applications. The buyer and unit of  licensing (per user 
versus per gigabyte or per instance) will change, but the techniques, 
or  acquisition  and  retention,  are  fundamentally  the  same.  Acquire  
customers as quickly and cheaply as possible, and hang on to them 
for as long as you can.
The  SaaS  Marketing  Handbook  begins  by  dispelling  a  few  myths  that  
could  stand  in  the  way  of  good  execution.  The  guide  then  starts  
with  the  basics—the  very  particular  language  of  SaaS  marketing  
that  allows  you  to  take  part  in  planning  discussions  and  keep  up  
with  the  conversation.  Readers  having  SaaS  product  selling  or  
marketing  experience  can  skim  or  skip  ahead  to  the  The  Roadmap  
to  SaaS  Marketing  Maturity  section.  Setting  a  strategy  for  customer  
acquisition  and  selecting  the  right  sales  model  is  next,  followed  by  
building a funnel and measuring demand, and then on to techniques 
for building demand. The final sections deal with management and 
company boards, and making sure you avoid common pitfalls while 
setting appropriate expectations on timing, goals, and budget.

Like  any  business  model  that  has  made  billions  for  executives  and  
shareholders,  SaaS  has  its  own  mythology.  Stories  heard  in  the  
boardrooms of  SaaS titans have been passed down to aspiring SaaS 
CEOs. Ambitious CMOs who want a piece of  the SaaS game often 
embellish their conversation stats—which is to say, be wary of  SaaS 
war stories. Make sure to separate history from lore. Here are four 
common SaaS marketing myths dispelled. Read these first lest ye be 
burned.

doing them. Focus on what works. If you’ll just quit 
what you’ve been doing, instead of doggedly doing it 
harder,  you  at  least  create  an  opportunity—some 
“space”—to do something else. 
Quantum  leaps  come  when  you  seek  the  elegant 
solution.  So  look  for  an  approach  characterized  by

For Non-Technical Business Owners: This audience is the least interested in the 
underlying technology and the most focused on the ultimate outcome. The AI is a black 

box to them; they only care about what comes out of it. The messaging must be 
ruthlessly simple, tangible, and jargon-free. 
○ 
Focus: Frame the AI in a way that is instantly relatable. The concept of ""AI 
employees"" used by the work management platform Motion is brilliant because it 
reframes software as a digital workforce that can delegate tasks and scale capacity 
without new hires.
13
 The benefit should be immediate and clear, such as 
""Autonomous AI for billing, contracts, and collections"".
23 
○ 
Language: Use analogies, everyday metaphors, and storytelling to explain complex 
ideas.

 Focus on emotional benefits: peace of mind, more free time, less frustration. 
The goal is to make them feel understood and empowered, not intimidated by 
technology.

Addressing AI-Specific Concerns: Privacy and Ethics 
 
For certain audience segments, particularly local business owners or those in regulated 
industries, the promise of AI is overshadowed by legitimate concerns about data privacy, 
security, and ethical use. For these groups, addressing these fears is not an afterthought—it is 
a core component of the value proposition and a powerful competitive differentiator.
24 
Building a privacy-first marketing culture is essential.
26
 This means moving beyond boilerplate 
legal disclaimers and integrating transparency into the very fabric of the product's messaging. 
A proactive approach to privacy builds trust, which is the foundation of customer loyalty.
25 
Key messaging points to include are: 
● 
Transparent Data Handling: Clearly and simply communicate what data is collected, 
why it is needed, and how it will be used. Avoid complex legal terms.
24 
● 
User Control: Emphasize that the user is in control. This includes providing clear options 
to opt out of data collection for personalization and easy ways for users to access and 
manage their data.
24 
● 
Data Minimization: Communicate a commitment to collecting only the data that is 
absolutely essential to provide the service. This demonstrates respect for user privacy 
and reduces liability.
25 
● 
Commitment to Ethical AI: If applicable, explain the steps taken to mitigate bias in AI 
models and ensure fairness. This positions the brand as a trusted and responsible 
partner.
28 

By weaving these elements directly into the value proposition and marketing materials, an AI 
SaaS can turn a potential objection into a compelling reason to choose its solution over less 
transparent competitors. For a privacy-conscious buyer, a clear and honest privacy policy is a 
more valuable feature than a dozen minor functionalities. 
 
Chapter 3: Strategic Pricing and Positioning for Early Adopters 
 
Pricing an MVP is a delicate balancing act. On one hand, the product has a limited feature set, 
which might suggest a lower price. On the other hand, early adopters are taking a higher risk 
and providing invaluable feedback, which suggests they deserve a premium for their support.
7
 
Furthermore, price is a powerful signal of quality and value; pricing too low can permanently 
anchor the product in the ""cheap"" category, making it difficult to raise prices later.
7
 This 
chapter outlines strategies to price an MVP in a way that reinforces its value, attracts the right 
kind of early customer, and establishes a solid foundation for future revenue growth. 
 
Choosing Your MVP Pricing Model 
 
There is no one-size-fits-all pricing model for an MVP. The right strategy depends on the 
product, the target market, and the primary business objective—whether it's maximizing early 
revenue or accelerating adoption.
7
 For a paid-first MVP on a shoestring budget, models that 
generate immediate revenue and validation are generally preferable. Here are five effective 
strategies, with a focus on those best suited for a B2B context 
7
: 
1. 
Pilot Pricing: This is arguably the strongest model for a new B2B SaaS MVP. It involves 
offering a substantial discount, typically 30-50% below the intended future market rate, 
to a handpicked group of early customers. The key to this strategy is the explicit 
agreement: in exchange for the special pricing, these customers commit to providing 
regular, structured feedback and serving as future reference customers or testimonials. 
This model brilliantly reframes the relationship. The customers are not beta testers; they

Find  a  price  that  is  acceptable  to  your  target  customers  and  can  
sustain  your  business.  Pricing  a  SaaS  product  is  a  complex  topic  
that  is  beyond  the  scope  of  this  eBook,  but  here  are  a  few  basic  
considerations to get you started. (A few SaaS pricing references are 
listed at the end of  this eBook.)
PRICING UNIT
What are you selling and how is it measured? Is it per user, per server, 
per mega- or gigabyte, or something else? 
PROFITABILITY
 How much money do you need to earn to support your business? 
Understand  your  total  costs  (not  just  CAC),  make  conservative  
assumptions on customer lifetime and churn rate, and then model your 
business at different price points. Your tolerance for profitability—
and that of  your investors—should be taken into account. 
COMPETITIVE COMPS
 You may not be the first to market, so your hand may be forced by 
your competitor’s pricing strategy. Take a look around and see what 
others  are  doing.  Your  strategy  will  dictate  if  you  want  to  be  the  
low-cost  provider,  or  set  premium  pricing  based  on  your  product’s  
capabilities.
BUYER BEHAVIOR
How  are  your  buyers  used  to  purchasing  a  product  like  yours?  If  
they’re used to paying per user and your model is per gigabyte, that 
might introduce confusion—and thus friction—into your sale. Now, 
if  you are trying to disrupt a market, that’s another story. You may 
introduce a radical model that fundamentally changes the game.

SaaS, this challenge is amplified. The term ""AI"" itself is both a powerful buzzword and a 
source of confusion, skepticism, and fear. A successful value proposition must therefore not 
only communicate the product's core benefit but also translate the complexity of AI into 
tangible, desirable outcomes for a diverse audience. This chapter provides a tactical 
framework for building a message that resonates with everyone from deep-learning engineers 
to privacy-conscious small business owners. 
 
The Anatomy of a SaaS Value Proposition 
 
A strong SaaS value proposition is a concise, powerful statement that answers the 
fundamental question in a potential customer's mind: ""Why should I buy your software?"".
11
 It is 
the foundation of the product's story and should serve as the north star for all marketing 
efforts.

 While the exact wording will evolve, a winning value proposition is built on a simple, 
proven structure comprising three essential elements

features for free, with more advanced functionality, higher usage limits, or premium 
support reserved for paying customers. Slack is a classic example, offering a generous 
free tier with a clear upgrade path once a team's needs grow.
7
 This model can be 
effective for products that benefit from network effects or require mass adoption to 
demonstrate their full value. However, for a bootstrapped MVP, it carries the risk of 
attracting a large number of free users who never convert, straining resources without 
providing revenue validation. If this path is chosen, the conversion path must be 
exceptionally clear and compelling. 
5. 
Freemium-to-Premium Migration: This is a longer-term strategy that involves offering 
the initial version of the product completely free to maximize user acquisition and build a 
large user base. Monetization is introduced only after achieving significant usage metrics 
and establishing strong product-market fit. Evernote famously used this model for years.
7
 
While powerful for venture-backed startups focused on rapid growth, this approach is 
generally not recommended for a shoestring MVP that needs to validate its business 
model and generate revenue early on. 
 
The ""Early Adopter"" Landing Page 
 
The pre-launch landing page is more than just a tool for collecting email addresses; it is a 
critical positioning asset that sets the tone for the entire launch. A poorly framed landing 
page can inadvertently position the product as a free beta, while a well-crafted one can build 
a queue of eager, high-quality potential customers. 
The language used is paramount. The call to action should not be ""Sign up for our beta."" 
Instead, it should be ""Apply for the Pilot Program,"" ""Request Early Access,"" or ""Join the 

Founding Members."" This subtle shift in wording transforms the proposition from a request for 
help into an offer of exclusivity.
8 
A strategic waitlist does more than just validate demand; it helps refine the product and build 
momentum. The key is to attract users who genuinely need the solution, not just a massive list 
of passive, curious onlookers.

BRANDS ARE RESILIENT 
Brand resilience refers to the ability of a brand to resist external shocks that might affect people’s 
willingness to buy a brand. Contrast these two historic examples,

over sudden acceleration, including a reported 89 deaths. In 2011, Toyota’s market share 
dropped almost 2 percentage points but recovered most of the loss the following year.  
• A decade earlier, Firestone and Ford were involved in a controversy over tire failures and 
rollovers  affecting  the  Ford  Explorer,  reported  to  have  resulted  in  271  deaths.  This  cost 
Bridgestone, owner of the Firestone brand, billions, caused it market price to fall by over 
half, and resulted in a decline in consumer demand for the Firestone brand.

Choosing the Right Content Formats for a Technical Audience 
 
The medium is as important as the message. A technical audience consumes information in 
specific ways, and the content strategy must cater to these preferences to be effective.

● 
Long-Form Blog Posts & Whitepapers: These are the cornerstones of an 
authority-building content strategy. They provide the space needed for in-depth analysis, 
showcasing true expertise and performing well in search engine rankings for niche 
topics.
15 
● 
Technical Tutorials & How-To Guides: This is arguably the most critical format for 
developers and engineers. They provide hands-on, step-by-step instructions that allow 
users to learn by doing. These guides should be rich with code snippets, screenshots, 
and practical examples, enabling users to apply their knowledge immediately.

● 
API Documentation: For any SaaS with an API, the documentation is a product in itself. It 
must be meticulously maintained, easy to navigate, and comprehensive. Developers will 
judge the quality of the entire product based on the quality of its documentation.

● 
Webinars and Virtual Summits: These formats offer a dynamic way to engage the 
audience, allowing for real-time Q&A sessions and deeper dives into complex topics. 
They also provide an opportunity to feature guest experts, further boosting credibility.

DEPLOY DIFFERENT TYPES OF MARKETING 
Marketing  as  practiced  today  is  a  hugely  complex  business,  involving  many  different  types  of  
marketing  activity  and  different  service  suppliers,  including  a  vast  array  of  companies  which  
support  the  technology  platforms  for  buying  and  delivering  advertising. Here  we  describe  two  
broad types of marketing activity and cover other, more specific formats in the glossary.  
 
1. Brand building 
Brand  building  is  any  marketing  activity  designed  to  build  demand  for  the  brand  by  
changing or strengthening people’s brand awareness and attitudes. Sustainability is most 
likely to be part of a brand building campaign. 
 
Brand building is often assumed to be the domain of traditional, broadcast advertising like 
TV, radio, billboards, print, and sports or event sponsorship. Brand building is also assumed 
to  work  over  the  long-term,  i.e.,  influencing  tomorrow’s  sales.  Both  assumptions  are  
incorrect, but commonplace.  There is absolutely no reason why digital marketing cannot 
help  build  a  brand,  if  it  is  used  with  that  intention,  and  if  advertising  does  not  generate 
sales  among  people  ready  to  buy  today,  it  is  unlikely  to  have  much  influence  on  future

need to generate 200 closed opportunities. Your VP of  sales believes 
his reps can close one out of  every three potential deals. Thus, 200 
× 3 = 600 SQLs. 
STEP  4:  Calculate  the  number  of  MQLs  needed  to  provide  sales  
with 600 SQLs. Having worked with this team for awhile, you know 
that  sales  accepts  all  of  our  MQLs,  so  the  number  of  SALs  and  
MQLs are the same. You also know that sales qualifies approximately 
three in every four MQLs (75%). 600 ÷ 0.75 = 800. You need 800 
MQLs to generate 600 SQLs. 
STEP  5:  Now  determine  how  many  initial  inquiries  you  need  to  
produce 800 MQLs. You know that about 50% of  them convert to 
MQLs. 800 ÷ 0.50 = 1,600 inquiries required. 
When your process gets more mature, you should measure the ratio 
of  inquiry to MQL by channel and create a weighted average. For 
example, display ads may convert less frequently than pay-per-click 
(PPC) ads, so calculate a weighted average for overall conversion that 
takes this into account. (Hopefully, in this case it goes without saying 
that you should shift your spend to PPC as well).
STEP 6: Our final step—and potentially the most discouraging—is 
to factor in your direct mail response rate and that of  the free trial on 
your website. Let’s say this rate is 2%. 1600 ÷ 0.02 = 80,000. Thus, 
to  obtain  1,600  inquiries  you  need  a  combined  80,000  prospect  
names sourced from both your database and website visitors. 

25  THE SAAS MARKETING HANDBOOK / TIM MATTHEWS
Be  a  realist,  not  a  Pollyanna  when  creating  your  funnel  model.  
Your  sales  price  should  be  your  average  sales  price—reflecting 
typical discounts—not your suggested list price. When in doubt, be 
conservative  by  picking  lower  conversion  rates.  Keep  in  mind  that  
conversion rates are usually much higher for existing customers, so 
treat  them  well  and  market  new  products  to  them  whenever  you  
can.  If  your  CFO  wants  to  know  why  marketing  needs  so  much

The Headline: This is the first point of contact. In a single, punchy sentence, it must 
articulate the primary end-benefit for the customer. It should be specific, credible, and 
attention-grabbing. Successful headlines often name the audience (""for global teams"") 
or quantify a result (""used by 10,000+ designers"") to build immediate trust.
13
 Examples 
like Slack's ""Slack is where work happens"" or Shopify's ""The platform commerce is built 
on"" are masterful because they are short, memorable, and focus on a high-level 
outcome.
11 
2. 
The Sub-headline (or Short Paragraph): This element adds clarity and context. It 
should briefly explain what the product is, who it is for, and the key benefit it delivers. The 
crucial mistake to avoid here is listing features. Customers do not buy features; they buy 
better versions of themselves. The copy must translate technical capabilities into 
real-world benefits.
11
 For example, instead of stating, ""Our software integrates with over 
50 platforms,"" a benefit-focused approach would be, ""Streamline your workflow by 
connecting all your tools in one place"".
11
 The goal is to ditch the tech talk and make it 
crystal clear how the product will improve the customer's daily life.
11 
3. 
The Visual Element: A hero image, a short video, or an animated GIF should visually 
reinforce the message of the headline and sub-headline. It should show the product in 
action, delivering the promised benefit. A common mistake is using a visual that 
introduces unrelated features or distracting animations, which pulls attention away from 
the core message.
13
 The visual and the text must work in harmony to tell a single, 
coherent story. 
The ultimate test of a value proposition is its clarity and conciseness. A single sentence that 
packs a punch is far more effective than a paragraph of fluff.
11
 It must be clear enough for 
both humans and machines to understand, especially in an era of AI-generated product 

summaries.
13 
 
The AI Translation Layer: Messaging for a Mixed Audience 
 
An AI SaaS product rarely has a monolithic audience. The user base for this MVP is a prime 
example, spanning from highly technical AI enthusiasts to non-technical business owners. A 
one-size-fits-all message is doomed to fail. To succeed, marketing communications must 
employ a ""Translation Layer,"" a strategic approach that adapts the core value proposition to 
the specific language, priorities, and pain points of each audience segment.
14 
● 
For AI Enthusiasts and Developers: This audience is technically fluent and deeply 
skeptical of marketing hype. The messaging for them can and should be more technical. 
They want to understand the ""how"" behind the ""what."" 
○ 
Focus: Emphasize the unique technical architecture, the specific AI models being 
used (e.g., fine-tuned Llama 3, a proprietary model), API quality, and any novel 
approaches to data processing or model training.
15 
○ 
Language: Use their language. Terms like ""vector database,"" ""low-latency inference,"" 
and ""fine-tuning"" are not jargon here; they are signals of credibility.
16
 Show, don't just 
tell. Provide code snippets, links to technical documentation, and performance 
benchmarks.
17 
○ 
Example Value Prop: ""Build and deploy private, fine-tuned LLMs with our serverless 
inference API. Zero config, pay-per-token, and 90% lower latency than self-hosting."" 
● 
For Corporate AI Implementers and IT Managers: This audience acts as a bridge 
between the technical and business worlds. Their primary concerns are ROI, security, 
scalability, and seamless integration with existing tech stacks. They are under pressure to 
make sound technology decisions that benefit the entire organization.
18 
○ 
Focus: The message must be centered on business outcomes. How does this AI tool 
reduce costs, increase efficiency, mitigate risk, or generate revenue?.
19
 Security, 
compliance (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA), and integration capabilities are non-negotiable 
points to address.
4 
○ 
Language: Use business and financial terminology. Frame benefits in terms of hitting 
KPIs, improving team productivity, and achieving strategic goals.
19
 Social proof, such 
as logos of other companies using the product or case studies with measurable 
results, is extremely persuasive.

Shared understanding about the purpose of a MVP: The MVP concept presented challenges
for management and development teams as its purpose was misunderstood (e.g. MVP seen as
a product to be delivered as opposed to a means for learning). This led to team members
experiencing a sense of‘failure’when an MVP required pivots or a fear that colleagues or
management would consider their outputs to be of low quality. Management and develop-
ment teams need to be informed from theoutset about the purpose of the MVP.
Balancing feasibility with desirability and viability: Members of the innovation team
possessed strong technical skills, which enabled them to create software that showcased
their technical know-how. However, efforts had to be made on a continuous basis to
ensure that issues of desirability and viability were also being considered in the design
of the MVPs.
Achieving PMF requires organisation-wide support: The Edtech Research Centre pro-
ducedfive MVPs, but not all of them ended up being released to the market. As Texuna
did not have the sales and marketing capabilities to actively market these products,
opportunities were lost. These capabilities need to be developed within the company in
order to leverage emergent opportunities.
Changing organisational culture: The cultural differences between the high-speed
learning approach clashed with the slower paced culture of Texuna. The agility of the
innovation team and its ability to make prompt decisions challenged the status quo,
which created tensions. Changing the organisational culture requires continued support
of the organisational leadership and in certain instances a compromise may be required
to satisfy all stakeholders.
There is a strong rationale underpinning each component of the MVP-PMF con-
ceptual framework and the MVP process map. We would, therefore, strongly discou-
rage practitioners from adopting all components without reflection and tailoring.
Instead, companies should ensure that the Lean Start-up approach is considered
within its wider innovation management portfolio. Each component of the diagrams
presented in this paper may be more relevant and critical in certain product/software
design contexts than others. We encourage practitioners to reflect on each and to
adopt or tailor as necessary in order to determine whether the Lean Start-up itself is
suitable in that instance.

BRANDING 
WHAT IS A BRAND? 
There are two sides to any brand:  
1. The tangible assets that the brand owner controls, including the product or products, the 
design,  customer  service,  marketing  communications, packaging, brand  name  and  logo. 
Depending  on  the  nature  of  the  company,  the  brand  could  be  synonymous  with  the  
company or applied to a specific product offered by that company.  
2. The intangible value created by the brand for potential buyers, which makes them more

This  said,  brand  building  typically  involves  mass-market  advertising  designed  to  
encourage people to choose the brand when the time comes to buy.  
 
2. Brand activation 
Brand activation refers to a raft of marketing activities designed to create deeper, more 
personal  engagement  with  existing  or  potential  customers.  On  average,  these  activities  
account  for  most  of  the  marketing  budget.  Some  of  the  most  relevant  to  sustainability  
initiatives might include the following: 
 
a) Experiential marketing 
Experiential  marketing  includes  events  and  one-on-one  experiences,  such  as  a 
demonstration of product performance, delivering extra care to valued customers, and 
grassroots events. Several brands allow customers to trace back their specific purchase 
to the family or farm that grew a raw ingredient used in its manufacture.

not a limitation; it is the entire goal. Long-tail keywords act as a magnet for the exact 
businesses and professionals who are looking for the specific solution the MVP offers, 
leading to higher-quality leads with greater lifetime value.
40 
● 
Cost-Effectiveness: From a paid advertising perspective, long-tail keywords have a 
much lower cost-per-click (CPC) due to the reduced competition, making them a smart 
choice for a limited budget.
40 
For an AI SaaS MVP, this strategy is not just an option; it is a necessity. The focus must shift 
entirely from chasing high search volume to precisely matching search intent.
44
 It is better to 
be the number one result for a keyword searched by 10 ideal customers per month than to be 
on page ten for a keyword searched by 10,000 unqualified users. 
 
Step-by-Step Niche Keyword Research Process 
 
Finding the right long-tail keywords requires a combination of creative brainstorming and 
data-driven analysis. The goal is to uncover the exact language the target audience uses 
when they are trying to solve the problem the MVP addresses. 
1. 
Brainstorm Seed Topics and Keyword Modifiers: Start by listing the core problems the 
product solves and its main features. Then, brainstorm ""modifier"" words that a B2B buyer 
would use. These often relate to industry, use case, price, or alternatives.
43 
○ 
Seed Topic: ""private AI model"" 
○ 
Industry Modifiers: for healthcare, for finance, for legal 
○ 
Use Case Modifiers: for document analysis, for customer support, for code 

generation 
○ 
Commercial Modifiers: software, tool, platform, alternative, pricing, vs 
○ 
Audience Modifiers: for small business, for enterprise teams, for developers 
2. 
Utilize Free and Freemium Research Tools: With these seed topics and modifiers, 
begin exploring keyword variations. 
○ 
Google Search: Type a query into Google and analyze the ""People Also Ask"" boxes 
and the ""Related searches"" at the bottom of the page. These are direct insights into 
what real users are searching for in relation to the topic.
42
 Google's autocomplete 
predictions as one types are another valuable source of ideas.
42 
○ 
Keyword Research Tools: While advanced tools like Ahrefs and Semrush have paid 
tiers, their free or freemium versions can still provide a wealth of information. Use 
them to explore keyword variations, see estimated search volumes, and, most 
importantly, analyze the Keyword Difficulty (KD) score, which measures how hard it is 
to rank in the top 10.
42 
○ 
AI Chatbots: Tools like ChatGPT can be used as brainstorming partners. A prompt 
like, ""I have an AI SaaS product that helps small law firms analyze case documents 
privately. What are some long-tail keywords a paralegal or lawyer might search for 
when looking for a solution like this?"" can generate a useful starting list.
42 
3. 
Mine Online Communities for ""Voice of Customer"" Data: The most valuable keywords 
are often not found in a tool but in the authentic conversations of the target audience. 
○ 
Niche Subreddits: Go to subreddits like r/law, r/sysadmin, r/MachineLearning, or 
industry-specific forums. Search for terms related to the problem space and pay 
close attention to the exact phrasing people use in their questions and complaints. 
This is ""voice of customer"" data in its purest form.
42 
○ 
Q&A Sites: Explore sites like Quora and Stack Overflow for similar insights. 
4. 
Interview Early Users and Prospects: The most direct way to find relevant keywords is 
to ask the target audience. Drawing from the ""5 questions"" framework, ask early users 
and prospects questions like 
43
: 
○ 
""When you first realized you needed a solution for [problem], what were the first 
things you typed into Google?"" 
○ 
""Before you found us, what other tools or solutions were you looking at?"" 
5. 
Filter and Prioritize: After gathering a large list of potential keywords, filter it down 
based on two primary criteria:

Part of the solution is to map out the ways in which your sustainability initiatives might dovetail 
with those of the marketing department. Do your own assessment. Ask yourself... 
• Is  there  an  obvious  and  growing  awareness  of  sustainability  issues  among  potential  
buyers? 
• How is your brand positioned against those trends? 
• Does your specific initiative offer the potential to build an existing competitive strength or 
remedy  a  weakness?  Does  it  offer  the  potential  to  generate  sales  by  making  the  brand  
seem more relevant to consumers? More likeable? More innovative? Different in a good 
way? 
• Even if it does not offer an immediate return today, is sustainability something that could 
bring  competitive  advantage  in  the  future?  Either  because  of  the  changing  cultural  
mindset,  or  because  it  offers  a  way  to  disrupt  the  current  status  quo  in  your  product  
category.

 SaaS markets are saturated. Attention is expensive. Guerrilla marketing reframes the equation: 
small teams can dominate narrow attention niches (Discords, GitHub, subreddits, indie 
newsletters) where authenticity, surprise, and cultural timing outperform paid CPMs.

However, adapting an approach intended for
a start-up context so that it can work effectively in established companies with
established operating policies and procedures is challenging (Kirsner,2016). For
example, the development of an MVP, a fundamental concept of the Lean Start-up
approach, which enables companies to quickly start the learning process by inte-
grating feedback from early adopters (Blank,2007) has been identified as a key
challenge for established companies.
Reis (Ries,2011) advocates that a company should commence building as quickly
as possible with an MVP, which is a‘version of the product that enables a full turn of

version of the MVP and a second iteration of the evaluation process is required. This iterative

And as more companies move to make their products and services 
sustainable, more people are likely to act in favor of the brands they perceive to be doing the right 
thing for the planet.  
 
Today,  brands  are  often  included  as  an  asset  on  the  balance  sheet,  and  companies  will  seek  to 
quantify  that  value,  particularly  when  contemplating  the sale  or  acquisition  of  a  specific  brand. 
However,  separating  the  tangible  and  intangible  value  of  a  brand  is  a  complex  and  often  
judgmental  process.  Companies  like  Interbrand,  Kantar,  and  Brand  Finance have  created  third  
party brand valuation systems, which provide a useful and accessible means of judging a brand’s 
value, but of necessity these systems are relatively simplistic and rely on different data sets, which 
may result in different values being assigned to the same brand. 
 
THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT SUSTAINABILITY IS OF GROWING IMPORTANCE TO BRANDS 
The Kantar  BrandZ  Most  Valuable  Global  Brands  2020 report  finds  that  brands  with  a  high  
reputation  for  sustainability  are  worth  more  and  grow  faster  than  those  with  a  low  reputation.

popular with small and midsize companies, and was a good source

most to put on their credit card. Enterprise was our largest revenue 
generator. We had something for everyone.

The  next  step  is  to  design  a  sales  team.  This  likely  involves  a  
conversation  with  your  CEO  and  vice  president  of  sales.  The  
structure  of  the  team  should  follow  from  your  acquisition  model  
(below). Here are a few questions to ask yourself  to help determine 
which model could work for you.
• Is your product entirely self-service? Can a customer sign up, 
purchase with a credit card, and use the product successfully? 
If  so, do you need sales reps at all?
• What  is  your  product’s  ARR  and  anticipated  CLV?  Can  
a sales rep close enough deals to make it profitable? If the 
answer is no, then you either need to raise the price or make 
your product self-service.
• Is your customer used to buying from a sales rep, perhaps for 
cultural  reasons  or  regional  business  custom?  Can  sales  be  
done over the phone, or are there technical or cultural reasons 
why sales must be made face to face?
THE SALES MODEL
How to Staff a Team that Supports Your Acquisition Model
“Business leaders, sales 
executives, and investors are 
all looking to turn their brilliant 
ideas into the next $100 million 
revenue business. Often, the 
biggest challenge they face is 
the task of scaling sales.”
– Mark Roberge, SVP Sales, Hubspot

20  THE SAAS MARKETING HANDBOOK / TIM MATTHEWS
• Are  a  lot  of  decision  makers  involved  in  the  sale?  Is  an  
experienced  account  representative  needed  to  help  manage  
the buying cycle?
• Are  you  using  the  demo  acquisition  model,  where  an  
experienced sales engineer is required to set up the demo?
 
Armed with answers to the above questions, you should be able to 
determine which sales acquisition model works best. 
• Self-service – The sale can be completed without assistance 
from  another  human,  via  your  website  or  through  an  online  
store. Sometimes called a “touchless” sale.
•  Inbound  –  Prospective  customers  can  research  and  sign  up  
for your product via the Web, but need to speak to an inside 
sales person to complete the sale. 
•  Outbound  –  Inside  sales  representatives  (ISRs)  or  sales  
development  representatives  (SDRs)  make  outbound  calls

better to focus on growing value market share.

Given  the  importance  of  market  share  to  measuring  the  impact  of  marketing,  it  is  important  to  
identify  how  sustainability  initiatives  might  “ladder  up”  to  impact  market  share,  a  topic  we  will  
discuss later in this document.  
 
BRAND SIZE MATTERS 
At a very basic level brands generate sales by being easy to mind, easy to find, and easy to pay. 
That  is,  potential  buyers  must  think  of  the  brand  when  a  need  arises  and  the  brand  is  available  
when and where the buyer wants, and at a price they are willing or able to pay. 
 
This means big brands have inherent advantages over small ones because they are both easy to 
mind and easy to find. Easy to mind because a big brand is likely to be a habitual or obvious choice 
for many people, and likely has a big marketing budget help bring in new customers. Easy to find 
because  the  brand  will  be  widely  available  and  have  more  shelf  space  or  stores  than  the  
competition. The payoff to being easy to find is that if someone has little idea which brand they 
want to buy, or the brand they want is unavailable, they will likely go with the most easily available

THE IMPORTANCE OF SUSTAINABILITY MIGHT BE WIDER THAN ASSUMED 
Given  that  most  consumers  are  focused  on  getting  a  good  price  rather  than  worry  about  
sustainability  credentials  it  can  be  easy  to  underestimate  sustainability’s  potential  importance.  
However, segmentation studies indicate that most consumers respond positively to sustainability. 
 
 
The challenge is to find the right way to catch people’s attention and deliver the right sustainability 
message. 
 
SUSTAINABILITY CAN FIT INTO THE BRAND PLAN 
As  you  will  have  gathered,  there  are  many  places  where  there  might  be  opportunities  for  
sustainability to become part of a brand’s marketing plan, from integral overall goal to a means to 
engage a specific target audience. But where might your initiative fit for your brand?

Map at Texuna. The innovation team successfully developed and evaluatedfive MVPs
that provided large market opportunities for Texuna. However, a great deal of effort was
needed in order to build the core capabilities required within Texuna to leverage these
opportunities. For example, Texuna did not always have the sales and marketing
bandwidth or skillsets to actively market a number of these MVPs, which differed from
the traditional offerings of the company. The Synchronise Step was included to recog-
nise the need for changes in the parent organisation in order to take advantage of the
opportunities offered by the Lean Start-up approach. It could not be taken for granted
that an established company can benefit from the Lean Start-up approach without
internal changes (e.g. change in organisation culture, behaviours, systems, etc.).
It was noted that fatigue had set in within the innovation team whose members were often
working on daily release cycles in response to faster feedback from a growing number of pilot
sites. The fact the team was co-located with other company staffworking at a slower pace
created tension. Members of the innovation team felt they were being asked to shift from
a‘large team mentality’with its clearly defined functional roles to a more‘flexible mentality’
where they needed to‘roll up their sleeves’and take on different roles in order to get the job
done. This suited some people but not all. For example, a senior developer saw this as eroding
his‘market value’, which he felt, was based on producing high-quality code using leading
edge software tools. He wanted to be given clearly defined requirements rather than working
in an environment where the needs of the customers emerged in an agile participatory way.
Team members were encouraged to make fast and courageous decisions. The cultural
differences between the high-speed learning-based approach advocated by the Lean Start-
up approach openly clashed with the slower paced culture at Texuna. It was increasingly
apparent to the DRI that the former was not part of the dominant culture of the company

and that the only way it would survive is with the continued support of the organisational
leadership. Some internal stakeholders, however, advocated that the team should slow
down and indeed others felt that it should be disbanded. As a compromise, the executive
leadership requested that the speed be reduced and that other areas of the company would
use some of the expertise within the team. For example, team members were increasingly
asked to support the sales team in selling current products.
Throughout the project, the researchers compiled a set of generic evaluation ques-
tions (seeTable 1) that were collected from the discourses that took place at the ERC
regarding the resulting MVPs. These questions being used to test the concepts of
desirability, feasibility, and viability of an MVP.

A True Story 
I’m  sitting  in  a  quiet  room  at  the  Millcroft  Inn,  a 
peaceful  little  place  hidden  behind  the  pine  trees 
about an hour out of Toronto. It’s just past noon, late 
July,  and  I’m  listening to  the  desperate  sounds  of a 
life-or-death struggle going on a few feet away. 
There’s a small fly burning out the last of its short 
life’s  energies  in  a  futile  attempt  to  fly  through the 
glass  of  a  windowpane.  The  whining  wings  tell  the 
poignant story of the fly’s strategy — try harder. 
But it’s not working, 
The  frenzied  effort  offers  no  hope  for  survival. 
Ironically,  the  struggle  is  a  part  of  the  trap.  It is 
impossible for the fly to try hard enough to succeed at 
breaking through the glass. 
Nevertheless,  this  little  insect  has  staked  its  life  on 
reaching  its  goal  through  raw  effort  and 
determination. 
This fly is doomed to die. It will die there on the 
windowsill. 
Across the room, ten steps away, the door is open.

Most  people  operate  with  a  mindset  that  assumes 
success comes one step at a time. The unspoken but 
popular notion  is  that  we  must move  systematically 
from  our  present  level  of  achievement  to  the  next. 
Then, the thinking goes, from that stage we can begin 
working  toward  graduating  to  still  the  next  higher 
level in the sequence. Gradual progress. 
This  is  an  unfortunate  misconception,  and  it’s 
clearly  reflected  in  the  way  we  function.  They  go 
about, day to day, striving to make incremental gains 
in their performance. That’s pretty routine. That’s the 
pathway of conventional growth. 
But your life simply does not always have to operate 
that way. 
Advancing at a measured pace—step by step from 
where  you  are  to  a  little  bit  better—ordinarily  feels 
easier,  more  natural,  and  even  safer.  But  in  certain 
areas of your life you can just as easily think in terms 
of skipping levels. You can move from your present 
level  of  achievement  to  one  that  is  several  stages 
higher—directly.

That  consumer value  rests  in  the  
associations, expectations and emotions created by indirect learning, e.g., through word 
of mouth or advertising, and direct consumption experience. In other words, the brand is 
how people perceive and interpret everything the company does.  
 
The  sustainability  initiatives  a  company  pursues  will  have  an  influence  on  its  brand(s)  provided  
potential consumers know about them and can readily appreciate the benefits of those activities. 
 
A BRAND’S VALUE RESTS IN THE VALUE IT CREATES FOR BUYERS 
By creating value for customers –  even if it is only a convenient way to solve a need –  brands create 
value  for  their  owners.  People  are  more  likely  to  choose  familiar  and  desirable  brands  than  
unfamiliar ones. They are often willing to pay more money for brands that they find different and 
desirable. 
 
While there is growing concern over sustainability among the general public, to date only a small 
minority have  proved  willing  to  pay  more  for  a  sustainable  product. This  is  in  part  because  the  
majority of  people  do  not  feel  sustainability  is  of  immediate  and  personal  relevance  (no  matter  
what the scientific evidence). In a recent Kantar survey, 82% of people agreed that when people 
shop,  their  mind  is  on  saving  money  more  than  saving  the  planet.  However,  when  a  product  is 
priced on a par with alternatives, then sustainable credentials can prove the tipping point in favor

on a Shoestring 
 
 
Part I: The Pre-Launch Playbook: Architecting for Paid 
Success 
 
 
Chapter 1: The Paid-First MVP Mindset: From Minimum Viable to 
Minimum Valuable 
 
The conventional wisdom surrounding the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) often conjures 
images of duct tape, buggy interfaces, and a desperate plea for user feedback. This 
approach, born from the ""move fast and break things"" ethos, is fundamentally misaligned with 
the goal of launching a product that commands a price from day one. For the shoestring AI 
SaaS founder, the MVP cannot be a prototype; it must be a polished, reliable, and complete 
solution to a very specific, high-value problem. This chapter reframes the MVP concept, 
shifting the focus from minimum viable to minimum valuable, and establishes the foundational 
mindset required to justify a price tag from the moment of inception. 
 
Redefining the MVP for a Paid World 
 
An MVP intended for a paid launch is not the first 10% of a sprawling product roadmap. It is 
not a sketch, a wireframe, or a half-built application. It is, unequivocally, a product.
1
 Every 
version of this MVP, even the very first, must be usable, testable, and valuable in its own right. 
It must stand on its own as a functional solution with room to grow, not as a compromised 
version of a future promise.
1
 The core purpose of this refined MVP is to solve one specific 
problem with an exceptional degree of precision and reliability.
2
 This lean approach is not 

about shipping less; it's about focusing on the absolute essentials that drive tangible value for 
the user.
1 
To achieve this level of focus, a rigorous prioritization process is non-negotiable. The goal is 
to identify the bare minimum functionality required to test the product's core viability, not to 
build a comprehensive suite of features.
4
 Many companies make the critical error of stuffing 
their MVP with non-essential or overly complex features, forgetting that it is not the 
end-product.
1
 The objective is to collect the maximum amount of validated learning about 
customers with the least effort, and for a paid product, the most crucial piece of validated 
learning is their willingness to open their wallets.
5 
The prioritization process should filter every potential feature through a series of critical 
questions 
4
: 
1. 
Can the product function without this feature? If the core value proposition collapses 
without it, it's essential. If it's an enhancement, it can wait. 
2. 
Does the target audience explicitly want this feature? This must be based on direct 
research and interviews, not assumptions. 
3. 
Does this feature solve a critical, high-pain problem? The MVP must target a 
""hair-on-fire"" problem, not a minor inconvenience. 
4. 
Will this feature have a significant impact on revenue? For a paid MVP, features that 
directly enable or justify the price are paramount. 
5. 
Is this feature a non-negotiable part of the core product vision? 
For instance, an MVP for a healthcare SaaS platform might require document management, 
client management, and robust security to ensure regulatory compliance. These are 
must-haves. Features like time-tracking or marketing extensions, while useful, would be 
postponed for future iterations.
4
 This disciplined approach ensures that development 
resources are channeled exclusively into the features that deliver immediate, demonstrable 
value, forming the foundation of a product that people will pay for.
6 
 
The Psychology of ""Early Access"" vs. ""Beta Testing"" 
 
Language is not a trivial detail; it is a powerful tool that shapes perception and sets 
expectations. The way an early product is framed can mean the difference between being 
perceived as a premium, exclusive opportunity and a buggy, unfinished project seeking free 
labor.

Broadly speaking, the plan will detail what marketing activities will be conducted over a specific 
time frame, when they will be executed, how much will be invested in each one, and what results 
are expected. If the brand is pursuing a sustainability agenda, then the brand plan will detail how 
the brand intends to support and publicize its activities.  
 
The scope of the brand plan will depend on the remit of marketing within the company, but every 
marketer aims to influence their potential customers in some way. Marketers enlist the help of 
specialist  outside  agencies  to  execute  specific  tasks,  e.g.,  media  agency,  creative  agency,  digital  
agency,  and  consumer  insight  firms.  With  the  complexity  of  today’s  media  and  retail  landscape  
the  overall  brand  plan  is  likely  broken  down  by  specialist  discipline,  e.g.,  digital,  search  engine  
optimization, in-house creative development. Other silos within the company may focus on other 
stakeholder  audiences,  e.g.,  publicity  and  investor  relations.  And  each  silo  will  need  to  interact 
with other disciplines within the overall company, e.g., R&D, finance, IT, key account management, 
production, and distribution, and its suppliers.  
 
IMPLEMENT A MARKETING CAMPAIGN 
A marketing campaign refers to a specific program within the plan designed to achieve a specific 
objective  and  usually  built  around  a  common  idea  or  theme.  Increasingly,  companies  are  
promoting their commitment to sustainability in specific ads, e.g., Apple created an ad featuring a 
baby  to  promote  its  commitment  to  being  100  percent  carbon  neutral  for  its  supply  chain  and  
products by 2030.  
 
There are two different tasks involved in executing an effective marketing campaign: 
1. Media delivery 
The marketer must get the campaign content (otherwise known as advertising) to where 
it has the potential to be seen or heard. The media channel is like a road. A media channel 
could be TikTok, a podcast, or good, old fashioned TV ads. The marketer needs to pick the 
right road to get to the destination, an attentive audience. The marketing content is the 

 
13 
vehicle that travels along the chosen road. Choosing the right media channels and investing 
enough in them to achieve the desired marketing objective is important, but it is the means 
to an end, not the end itself.  
 
2. Creative impact 
Once the content gets to its destination it must then earn people’s attention long enough 
to  deliver  the  intended  impression.  How  well  the  marketing  content  evokes  a  positive  
emotional  response  is  critical  to  gain  attention  and  ensure  the  advertising  impression  is  
remembered. Many studies have identified creative as the single most important driver of 
marketing effectiveness after category and brand size. The impact of creative is less to do 
with format, e.g., Instagram post, online video, or radio ad, and more to do with how well 
it  captures  people’s  attention. Typically,  content  that is  enjoyable,  interesting,  relevant, 
and distinctive is most effective.

INTRODUCTION 
It is generally agreed that a strong brand can be a valuable asset, yielding sales and profits over 
what would be achieved by a similar, generic product, and that marketing plays an important role 
in  creating  that  value  through  its  influence  on  consumer  behavior.  However,  to  the  outsider  
branding  and  the  practice  of  marketing  can  seem  complex,  obscure,  and  sometimes faddish.  In  
part, that is because, unlike the physical sciences,  some of the basic principles have yet to be fully 
understood and agreed.

One  of  the  reasons  that  Toyota  was  relatively  unscathed,  and  Firestone  was  not,  is  due  to  the  
strength  of  their  brands.  Toyota  had  a  strong  reputation  for  quality  and  reliability.  By  contrast,  
Firestone was not that well-known or trusted.  
 
Brands often prove to be more resilient than expected. In part this is because unless there is some 
direct, personal threat, people can easily shrug off or ignore a crisis. Another reason is that it takes 
time for the downside risk of a crisis to become fully apparent. Even if Toyota owners had decided 
not  to  buy  that  brand  again,  it  might  have  taken  years  for  them  to  get  round  to  buying  a  
replacement vehicle, by which time memories of the crisis would have faded. Attitudes to brands 
are  forged  over  decades  and  it  takes  a  lot  to  change  them.  The  biggest  risk  to  a  brand  is  that  a  
competitor innovates first and disrupts the category. 
 
FAILURE TO INNOVATE CREATES BRAND RISK 
According  to  Kantar,  61%  of  consumers  believe  sustainability  is  the  responsibility  of  businesses  
and producers. Not living up to those expectations poses a risk, particularly if a competitor makes 
sustainability  an  advantage  for  their  brand.  And  brand  can  suffer  when  called  out  over  
greenwashing.  For  instance,  prior  to  its  diesel  emissions  scandal,  VW  had  advertised  the  
“greenness” of its diesel vehicles in the USA, likely exacerbating the negative consumer response 
to the scandal. While the scandal’s  impact on vehicle sales was largely short-term, the cost to VW

KEEP IT SIMPLE 
You  know  all  too  well  that  making  a  company  more  sustainable  is  fraught  with  challenges.  
However, simplicity sells. Before you make your pitch to marketing spend a little time to figure out 
how you can put your ideas across as simply as possible.

GLOSSARY OF ADDITIONAL MARKETING TERMINOLOGY 
Acquisition 
9  out  of  10  times  a  brand  grows  if  it  increases  its  penetration.  This  means  that  the  brand  must  
acquire enough new users to offset people who defect or fail to buy again during the specific time 
frame.  
 
Ad Impression 
Typically used in the context of media planning and evaluation, an impression when someone is 
exposed to an ad. (Given the complexities of digital media, viewable impressions are defined as 
those where the ad was visible to the user for a specific time frame.)  
 
Attitudinal Data 
Any form of consumer feedback involving questioning. This could be qualitative, usually involving 
small numbers of people, interviewed in-depth in the form of a guided discussion, or quantitative, 
usually  involving  a  predetermined  survey  asked  of  at  least  100  or  more  people  sampled  to  be

a start-up context so that it can work effectively in established companies with
established operating policies and procedures is challenging (Kirsner,2016). For
example, the development of an MVP, a fundamental concept of the Lean Start-up
approach, which enables companies to quickly start the learning process by inte-
grating feedback from early adopters (Blank,2007) has been identified as a key
challenge for established companies.
Reis (Ries,2011) advocates that a company should commence building as quickly

what they have learned about customers it is known as pivoting (Bosch, Olsson,

measurable Return on Investment (ROI) or cost savings. Instead of basing the price on 
development costs or competitor pricing, it is anchored to the economic value the 

solution provides to the customer. The price is set as a percentage of the value 
created—for example, a procurement optimization tool might charge 20% of the 
documented savings it generates for a client.
7
 For an MVP, this can be a powerful way to 
justify the price, as it directly aligns the product's cost with its success. It requires deep 
customer research to quantify the value, but when the ROI is clear, it allows for premium 
pricing even with a limited feature set. 
3. 
Incremental Value Pricing: This model is ideal for products with a clear and transparent 
public roadmap. The initial price is set low to reflect the MVP's limited feature set, 
rewarding early adopters for their faith in the product's vision. However, the company 
communicates transparently that the price will increase as new features and capabilities 
are added. According to research from ProfitWell, companies that implement this 
strategy see an average revenue increase of 22% during their early evolution phases.

This approach builds loyalty by making early customers feel smart for getting in on the 
ground floor, while setting a clear expectation of rising value and price over time.

Annual Contract Value (ACV)  –  This  is  the  annual  value  of  a  
customer contract.
Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) – This is the annual revenue 
that is expected to renew (recur) for a customer or set of  customers. 
ARR  is  the  total  contracted  revenue  of  all  customers,  minus  the  
percentage  that  won’t  renew—the  churn.  Note  the  difference 
between this and ACV, which doesn’t include churn. ACV is useful 
when discussing an individual account or when building your funnel 
for  new  business.  ARR  is  useful  when  discussing  the  state  of  a  
company’s overall business.

as time and space, and how the human consciousness 
operates. 
Quantum  physics  also  has  staggering  implications 
regarding you, your potential, and the power of the 
mind. To put it simply, as human beings we are going 
to have to reframe our ideas about the universe and 
how we fit into it. 
Fred Alan Wolf, in his award-winning book titled 
Taking the Quantum Leap, describes the term as... 
the explosive jump that a particle of matter undergoes in 
moving  from  one  place  to  another...in  a  figurative 
sense,  taking  the  quantum  leap  means  taking  a  risk, 
going off into an unchartered territory with no guide to 
follow. 
Physicists  studying  quantum  mechanics  note  that 
particles  make  these  “jumps” without  apparent  effort 
and without covering all the bases between the starting 
and ending points. 
What’s going on here? How does this happen? And 
is it possible for you as an individual to do something 
very similar in your personal performance?

 This disciplined approach ensures that development 
resources are channeled exclusively into the features that deliver immediate, demonstrable 
value, forming the foundation of a product that people will pay for.

The Psychology of ""Early Access"" vs. ""Beta Testing"" 
 
Language is not a trivial detail; it is a powerful tool that shapes perception and sets 
expectations. The way an early product is framed can mean the difference between being 
perceived as a premium, exclusive opportunity and a buggy, unfinished project seeking free 
labor. 
The term ""beta test"" inherently implies incompleteness. It signals to the user that the product 
is likely to have bugs, that features are missing, and that their primary role is to act as an 

unpaid quality assurance tester. This framing benefits the founder by offloading the testing 
burden, but it simultaneously devalues the product in the user's mind. When a user is asked to 
""test"" something, the implicit contract is that their time and feedback are the currency of 
exchange, not their money. 
Conversely, positioning the launch as an ""Early Access Program"" or a ""Pilot Program"" 
completely reframes the dynamic.
7
 This language suggests exclusivity and privilege. It 
positions early adopters not as testers, but as founding members or valued partners who are 
being granted a special opportunity. They are insiders, given the chance to shape the future 
of a promising new tool before it becomes widely available.
2
 This psychological shift is critical 
for a paid launch. It creates a compelling reason to join that goes beyond mere curiosity; it 
taps into the desire for status, influence, and access to innovation.
8 
This positioning must be reinforced with tangible benefits that reward the early adopter's 
commitment. These are not just users; they are the first believers, and they should be treated 
as such. Perks can include: 
● 
Exclusive Pricing: Offering significant lifetime discounts or special founding member 
rates acknowledges their early support and locks in their loyalty.

1  THE SAAS MARKETING HANDBOOK / TIM MATTHEWS
Software-as-a-Service  (SaaS)  is  a  means  of  delivering  software  
to  customers  over  the  Internet,  removing  the  need  to  install  and  
maintain  software  on  hardware  servers  owned  by  customers.  The  
delivery model has two important ramifications for SaaS businesses. 
First,  it  removes  technical  and  budgeting  obstacles  to  a  sale;  
customers  can  directly  test  and  purchase  software  without  lengthy  
hardware  procurement  and  software  configuration.  Second,  since 
SaaS is sold as a subscription, SaaS companies can grow quickly as 
existing customers renew their subscriptions and an equal or greater 
number of  new customers is acquired. 
Both  the  change  in  buyer  behavior  and  subscription  pricing  have  
specific impacts on your marketing department. SaaS puts even more 
of  the  buying  cycle  into  the  hands  of  marketing.  With  SaaS,  buyers  
research a product, and often try it out,  before even speaking to a sales 
person. Most buyers now expect to find the price of the SaaS product 
on the website. SaaS marketers need to take this change in the buyer 
journey into account when formulating a marketing strategy. 
Because  marketing  will  be  shouldering  more  of  the  load,  the  
department’s focus on metrics is critical. SaaS company CEOs will 
now  look  to  the  VP  of  sales  and  the  VP  of  marketing  for  business  
growth  forecasting.  The  sales/marketing  blame  game  won’t  cut  it  
anymore. SaaS is a numbers game, and marketers need to be more 
metrics-oriented than ever before.

for the business (Cooper & Vlaskovits,2010). Brown (Brown,2009) advocates that
a product must therefore fulfil and balance three overlapping criteria (i) desirability
(what people want), (ii) feasibility (what isfunctionally possible), and (iii) viability
(what is likely to become a sustainable business model). A business model describes
the viability of a company in terms of how it fulfilsitspurpose,itsgoalsandits
ongoing plans for achieving them.
From a practice perspective, the overlapping criteria require a multidisciplinary
approach that involves a diverse team of people with different skill-sets in order to
provide a holistic solution (Zupan & Nabergoj,2012). This study presents a process map
for developing MVPs that achieve these three criteria (desirability, feasibility, and
viability).
RELATED WORK ON THE LEAN START-UP APPROACH IN ESTABLISHED COMPANIES
The Lean Start-up approach has been proposed as a new
approach to innovation in situations where there is
extreme uncertainty regarding who the customer is
and what the customer’s needs are. A start-up is
defined (1) as‘a human institution designed to create
a new product or service under extreme uncertainty.
That means entrepreneurs are everywhere and the
Lean Start-up approach can work in any size company,
even a very large company, in any sector or industry.’
A study of 170 business executives by (2) reports that
82% of them are using some elements of the Lean
Start-up approach in their company and that
developing a MVP has been a specific challenge.
The Lean Start-up approach has been shown to be quite
effective (3) and is rapidly becoming the primary
model for start-up innovation, overcoming challenges
typically faced by start-ups, such as time and cost
constraints, limited to a very small number or even
a single entrepreneur, and facing competition from
established organisations with diverse and multi
skilled workforces, all of whom have access to
a massive and diverse set of resources. However,
despite this popular opinion, many established
companies often face similar constraints.
The MVP is a fundamental concept of the Lean
Start-up approach as it enables companies to
quickly start the learningprocessbyintegrating
feedback from early adopters. A review of
literature by (4) identified twenty-two definitions
of MVP in studies between 2001 and 2015.
Whether or not the Lean Start-up approach
might support software product innovation in
established companies and how best to approach
it remains under studied (5,6).
Previous studies that focused on the application of
the Lean Start-up approach in established
companies created frameworks that support the
setting up of‘internal’start-ups. While such
studies and associated frameworks provide much
needed guidance on setting up internal lean
start-ups, they do not support practitioners to
develop MVPs.
While this study builds on earlier work by (7), it
differs because the authors include the CEO of
Texuna and the former Director of Research and
Innovation (DRI) who provide reflections and
lessons learned from theirexperience. To the best
of our knowledge, it is thefirst study to empirically
investigate the development of MVPs, using the
Lean Start-up approach to developing MVPs in an
established software company.

BUILDING YOUR CONVERSION FUNNEL
TO EFFECTIVELY DRIVE DEMAND FOR A BUSINESS, your 
marketing organization must determine a target number of  leads it 
needs  in  each  stage.  The  easiest  way  to  calculate  these  numbers  is  
to  start  with  your  revenue  target,  and  then  work  backward  up  the  
funnel  (see  Figure  5).  Using  known  or  estimated  conversion  rates,  
along  with  the  average  sale  size,  you  can  reverse-calculate  how  
many SALs and SQLs you need to produce the required number of  
customers. Similarly, you can calculate how many MQLs you need

two or three quarters of  accurate revenue prediction by marketing 
and churn has settled at an acceptable level.
Timeframe: 6 – 9 months.

14  THE SAAS MARKETING HANDBOOK / TIM MATTHEWS
DRIVING  GROWTH  –  With  a  tuned  and  predictable  demand-
generation machine, the marketing team can be a growth driver. ARR 
should be well understood and churn should be stabilized. Investing 
more  in  marketing  to  make  existing  customers  more  valuable  –  by  
upselling additional features or modules – might be a final tweak.
These  timeframes  are  general;  they’re  based  on  discussions  with  
several  SaaS  CEOs  and  CMOs.  Heads  of  marketing  should  gain  
consensus regarding which growth stage the company is in, as well 
as those activities on which marketing is focused. Maturation takes 
time.  Executive  teams  may  grow  restless  and  want  to  move  on,  
but  until  you  have  invested  time  in  the  market  and  have  data  that  
supports your experiments, forecasts and predictions, you just won’t 
know if  you were right. Marketing may need to stand tall, insisting 
on discipline from other teams that either want to skip stages or are 
expecting  magic  to  happen.  If  you  join  a  company  years  after  its  
founding, either as the first CMO or a replacement, you may even 
need to walk the company back a stage or two if  they got ahead of  
themselves.

Online  customer  acquisition  is  a  hot  topic  in  SaaS  circles.  Some  
companies can execute “no-touch” models at scale, such as Google

to  use  your  software  before  talking  to  a  sales  person—are  more  
common. Here, customers can try out a product on their own terms

only to those customers who are ready to buy. Your product, however, 
may dictate a “high-touch” model, where sales and technical staff 
diligently  guide  a  customer  through  the  acquisition  process.  The  
following are four defined models for acquiring customers.
FREEMIUM
This  is  a  portmanteau  of  the  words  free  and  premium,  i.e.,  from  
free  to  premium.  Here,  customers  are  provided  a  useful  piece  of  
free software, with the option to purchase a premium version having 
additional features. Some SaaS companies build in a viral aspect to 
their  software,  so  that  even  though  freemium  version  users  aren’t  
paying, they add value as “advertisers.” Dropbox is a good example 
(and  a  service  I  used  in  the  editing  phase  of  this  ebook).  Dropbox  
Basic edition users share files with others and expose them to the file 
sharing service.
FREE TRIAL
Lets users sample software for some period of  time—usually a few 
weeks to a month—and then decide if  they want to buy it. Unlike 
freemium, users do not have software access after its trial period ends.

BLENDED
A free trial of your premium software version is offered for a limited 
time.  If  a  user  opts  not  to  purchase  after  the  trial  period  expires,  
they’re reverted to the free version having fewer features and possible 
other limitations. The idea is to hook customers on premium version 
features, using the free version as a no risk come-on.

and analysis of data all take significant manpower and expense. Just 
look at the IPO registration filings of young SaaS companies and 
you’ll see just how much it costs. In fact, it can be several times the 
typical marketing spend of  an enterprise software company. 
Thomasz Tomguz, a venture capitalist at Redpoint, has an excellent 
analysis of  sales and marketing spend of  34 public SaaS companies. 
In their first three years, these public SaaS companies spend between 80 
to 120 percent of  their revenue in sales and marketing!  
MYTH II — IT’S FAST
Reality  –  You  can  get  started  quickly  without  a  large  upfront  
investment, but getting good takes a long time. SaaS marketing is a 
game of continued refinement and measurement. As you will read 
in The Roadmap to SaaS Marketing Maturity section, each development 
phase can take several quarters.
DISPELLING SAAS 
MARKETING MYTHS

4  THE SAAS MARKETING HANDBOOK / TIM MATTHEWS
MYTH III — AUTOMATION MAKES IT EASY
Reality – Yes, there are amazing tools that are very affordable, and 
sometimes free. But everyone else is using those tools, too. You still 
need to get the basics right: a good product, a good offer, a solid 
understanding of  your buyer and their needs, and good execution. 
This is hard work. Also, all of  the A/B testing and experimenting is, in 
my opinion, more work than marketing teams have ever done before. 
Think of  it this way: for every deliverable marketing teams used to 
produce,  they  now  have  to  produce  at  least  twice  the  amount—an  
A  and  B—and  perhaps  an  ever-evolving  version.  I  would  argue  
that automation only raises expectations. (The Goosing Conversion and 
Fighting Churn section sheds more light on this.)
MYTH IV — SAAS MEANS FREEMIUM  
Reality  –  SaaS  is  a  delivery  model.  Freemium  is  an  acquisition  
model.  As  we  will  cover  later  in  The  Acquisition  Model,  freemium  is  
only  good  for  certain  products.  Many  complex  products,  such  as  
SaaS  accounting  packages,  require  a  more  conventional  enterprise  
software sales approach.

THE LANGUAGE OF CONVERSION
Name – As the generic nature of  the term suggests, this is just a name 
on  a  list  or  in  a  database.  At  this  point,  marketing  has  performed  
little, if any, qualification—except perhaps that this person matches 
the desired demographic or buyer profile.
Visitor – A visitor is a unique individual viewing a website. You can 
track a visitor using a cookie (if  the user hasn’t disabled cookies), but 
you  don’t  have  any  way  to  contact  the  person  and  may  not  know  
their name. 
Lead – At this stage, a prospect has responded to a marketing offer. 
He  or  she  has  expressed  some  level  of  interest  in  your  product  or  
service.  You  have  captured  their  email  address,  and  maybe  their  
company name and phone number.
Marketing-qualified  lead  (MQL)  –  An  MQL  is  a  lead  that  
marketing has qualified to some level and is ready to turn over to 
sales. The qualification process varies from company to company, 
but typically comprises a combination of profile (demographic, role) 
and activity (video watched, eBook downloaded). For example, you

A lot of  marketers overlook lost leads. They are a detour from the 
linear funnel we all prefer, but sometimes you can end up with truly 
enormous  lists  of  past  lost  opportunities  that  are  actually  good  
quality lists that canconvert when the timing is better.

Cost Per Lead (CPL) – CPL is how much a lead costs to acquire. 
Many  companies  also  measure  cost  per  MQL,  or  CPMQL,  since  
what you really want to know is what it costs to generate a lead that is 
ready to turn over to sales. Note the difference between this and CAC 
(next),  which  measures  total  sales  and  marketing  costs—including  
salaries. CPL helps you evaluate individual campaigns or programs, 
while CAC helps you in discussing the company’s overall financials 
with the CEO and board of  directors.
Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) – This is the total sales and 
marketing expense required to acquire a customer. Said another way, 
it’s the total amount spent to move a visitor to a customer.

There  is  an  additional  important  consideration.  Make  certain  
you  understand  how  much  new  revenue  your  marketing  team  is  
responsible for generating (in particular, how much new ARR, since 
renewals  won’t  require  new  leads).  In  many  SaaS  organizations,  
marketing is responsible for 100 percent of  the demand for new ARR. 
In  organizations  having  sales  development  reps  doing  outbound  
calling, or where territory reps prospect in their patch, it may only 
be 50 to 75 percent.

to generate $5 million in sales

24  THE SAAS MARKETING HANDBOOK / TIM MATTHEWS
After  you  have  established  your  revenue  target,  and  the  percent  
of qualified leads marketing needs to generate, you can start your 
calculations.  If  you  don’t  have  historical  data  to  rely  on,  you  can  
obtain conversion rates from a number of marketing research firms. 
These include Sirius Decisions and Forrester Research, in addition to 
the many excellent SaaS blogs, such as SaaStr and For Entrepreneurs.
Here  is  an  example.  Let’s  say  you  have  a  net  new  ARR  target  of  
$5  million.  Your  company  is  relatively  young,  with  new  ISRs  and  
little carried over pipeline, so the assumption is that marketing is to 
generate 100 percent of  the leads for new ARR. 
To keep the math simple, your product will sell for the non-negotiable 
ACV  of  $25,000.  Inverting  the  funnel  for  emphasis,  Figure  5  
illustrates this reverse-calculation process.

2. Background to Texuna
Founded in London in 2000, Texuna has offices located in the UK, Ireland and Russia.
Texuna has a strong reputation for designing scalable and secure data platforms that
adhere to international standards (e.g. ISO 27,001 for Information Security, ISO9001
for Quality Management, and ISO2000 for IT service management). Its client base
includes both public and private sector clients from a range of industries and it
supports in excess of 70,000 end-users dispersed across a large geographical area.
In 2012 the company collaborated with University College Cork (Ireland) in establish-
ing an Edtech Research Centre (ERC) for the purpose of investigating opportunities
for future products and services using customer-centric design methods. The ERC was
co-located with the company’s Shared Services Centre. The CEO sought to explore
new approaches that would enable the company to be more effective in bringing
product ideas forward to successful product launches. The research team recom-
mended the Lean Start-up approach to support the development of MVPs as the
existing software development method (Scrum) was not supporting the team to
develop multiple MVPs concurrently.
In itsfirst year of operation, the ERC adopted a Lean Start-up approach to successfully

crafted in the previous chapter must be front and center on the website, in email outreach, 
and in ad copy.

 This ensures that potential customers are constantly reminded of the problem 
being solved and the tangible benefits they will receive. 
While it's important to benchmark against competitors to understand the market landscape, 
pricing should not be solely dictated by what others are charging.
7
 An MVP with a unique 
value proposition can and should command a price that reflects that uniqueness. Price serves 
as an indicator of quality, especially for new products with limited market presence.
7
 A price 
that feels too low can signal a lack of confidence or a subpar product, undermining the 
premium positioning. 
Ultimately, pricing an MVP is an integral part of the product development process itself. It is 
not a ""set it and forget it"" decision. It should be tested, refined, and evolved based on market 
feedback and business objectives.
7
 By starting with a strategic model, positioning the offer as 

exclusive, and consistently communicating value, a founder can confidently charge for their 
MVP from day one, turning their first users into paying customers who are invested in the 
product's long-term success.

Chapter 4: Content as a Trojan Horse: Establishing Technical Authority 
 
For an AI SaaS startup, especially one targeting developers and technically-savvy 
professionals, content is not merely a marketing tactic; it is the primary vehicle for 
demonstrating credibility. Technical buyers are inherently risk-averse and possess a 
deep-seated skepticism towards marketing fluff.
15
 They cannot be persuaded with clever 
taglines alone. They must be convinced through a clear, consistent demonstration of 
expertise. This chapter outlines a content strategy designed to function as a Trojan Horse: 
delivering immense value and establishing technical authority, thereby earning the trust and 
attention of a discerning audience long before a sales pitch is ever made. 
 
Mapping Content to the AI Buyer Journey 
 
A successful content strategy for a technical audience must be meticulously mapped to their 
decision-making process. These buyers undertake a journey of education and validation, and 
the content must meet them at each stage with the right information and the right format.
15 
● 
Awareness Stage: Teaching the Basics and Framing the Problem
 
At this stage, potential users are identifying a challenge or exploring a new technology, 
but they are not yet evaluating specific solutions. The content goal is to educate, 
generate interest, and build foundational trust.15 The content should establish the brand 
as a knowledgeable guide in the AI space.

Content Types: 
■ 
Blog Series: A series of articles that explain core AI concepts within a business 
context. For example, ""A Practical Guide to Retrieval-Augmented Generation 
(RAG) for Customer Support"" or ""Understanding AI Hallucinations and How to 

Mitigate Them"".
15 
■ 
How-To Guides: Comprehensive guides that address fundamental decisions, 
such as the pros and cons of building an AI solution in-house versus buying a 
SaaS product.

Once a user is actively researching solutions, the content must shift to demonstrating the 
product's specific capabilities and proving its reliability. This is where deep technical 
details and social proof become paramount. 
○ 
Content Types: 
■ 
Detailed Case Studies: These are critical. They must go beyond surface-level 
success stories and detail the entire journey: the initial problem, the 
implementation process, the technical challenges overcome, and the measurable 
results. The case study should include technical specifics for the engineers and 
quantifiable business impact for the executives.
15 
■ 
Comparison Guides: Honest, in-depth comparisons of the product against 
direct competitors or alternative approaches (e.g., open-source libraries). 
Highlighting weaknesses of competitors is a powerful way to position the 
product's strengths.

Choosing the Right Content Formats for a Technical Audience 
 
The medium is as important as the message. A technical audience consumes information in 
specific ways, and the content strategy must cater to these preferences to be effective.
32 
● 
Long-Form Blog Posts & Whitepapers: These are the cornerstones of an 
authority-building content strategy. They provide the space needed for in-depth analysis, 
showcasing true expertise and performing well in search engine rankings for niche 
topics.
15 
● 
Technical Tutorials & How-To Guides: This is arguably the most critical format for 
developers and engineers. They provide hands-on, step-by-step instructions that allow 
users to learn by doing. These guides should be rich with code snippets, screenshots, 
and practical examples, enabling users to apply their knowledge immediately.
15 
● 
API Documentation: For any SaaS with an API, the documentation is a product in itself. It 
must be meticulously maintained, easy to navigate, and comprehensive. Developers will 
judge the quality of the entire product based on the quality of its documentation.
15 
● 
Webinars and Virtual Summits: These formats offer a dynamic way to engage the 
audience, allowing for real-time Q&A sessions and deeper dives into complex topics. 
They also provide an opportunity to feature guest experts, further boosting credibility.

SAAS IS A NUMBERS GAME. ANY SAAS MARKETER WORTH HIS SALT will know his metrics cold. Share them with others in your

area. As of  the writing of  this eBook, I am one to two quarters away from that goal.
Below are some of  the metrics I think a SaaS CMO should share, weekly and monthly (and daily once you get your monitor mounted)

Case Studies and Testimonials: While often text-based, these are a distinct format

Writing for Developers: Clarity, Accuracy, and No Fluff 
 
When creating content for a technical audience, the writing style must be adapted to their 
expectations. This audience values efficiency, precision, and authenticity above all else. 
● 
Clarity and Conciseness: Use clear, direct language. Write in an active voice with short 
sentences. While it's important to avoid unnecessary jargon that could alienate parts of 
the audience, using industry-specific terminology correctly is crucial for establishing 
credibility.
32
 A glossary of terms can be a helpful resource to maintain consistency and 
assist less technical readers.
32 

● 
Logical Structure: Content must be logically organized and easy to navigate. Use clear 
headings, subheadings, bullet points, and numbered lists to break down complex 
information into digestible chunks. A well-structured article allows a busy developer to 
quickly scan and find the exact information they need.
32 
● 
Authoritative Tone: The tone should be serious, confident, and helpful. The goal is to 
position the brand as an expert guide, efficiently leading the reader from a problem to a 
solution.
35
 Humor can be used sparingly, but only if it feels authentic and doesn't detract 
from the technical substance.
16 
● 
Accuracy is Paramount: Every technical claim, code sample, and data point must be 
rigorously fact-checked. A single inaccurate piece of information can destroy credibility. 
Incorporate a technical review stage into the editorial workflow, where subject-matter 
experts verify all content before publication.
32 
● 
Embrace Authenticity: Avoid marketing speak and corporate buzzwords like 
""innovative,"" ""robust,"" and ""cutting-edge"".
16
 This language is an instant turn-off for a 
skeptical technical audience. Instead, write as you would speak to a knowledgeable 
colleague. Sharing personal experiences, including challenges and failures, can add a 
genuine, human feel to the copy and build a stronger connection with the reader.
16 
By adhering to these principles, an AI SaaS startup can create a content engine that not only 
drives traffic but also builds a reputation for technical excellence—the most valuable currency 
when selling to developers. 
 
Chapter 5: The Long-Tail SEO Gambit: Winning Niche Search without a 
Budget 
 
For a new AI SaaS MVP operating on a shoestring budget, competing for broad, high-volume 
keywords like ""AI software"" is a futile and expensive endeavor. The search engine results 
pages (SERPs) for these terms are dominated by established industry giants with massive 
marketing budgets and years of accumulated domain authority.
39
 The only viable path to 
gaining a foothold in organic search is to sidestep this competition entirely. This is achieved 
through the Long-Tail SEO Gambit: a disciplined strategy focused on targeting highly specific, 
multi-word search queries that, while low in individual search volume, signal strong user intent 
and face significantly less competition. This chapter provides a step-by-step guide to finding, 
targeting, and ranking for the niche keywords that will drive qualified, high-converting traffic 
to an MVP. 
 
The Philosophy of Long-Tail Keywords for B2B SaaS 

 
Long-tail keywords are the unsung heroes of B2B marketing.
41
 These are longer, more 
conversational search phrases that users type when they have a very specific problem or are 
further along in their buying journey.
40
 A user searching for ""AI"" is browsing; a user searching 
for ""secure on-premise AI model for healthcare data analysis"" is looking to buy. 
The strategic advantages of focusing on long-tail keywords are manifold: 
● 
Lower Competition: Because these terms are so specific, fewer websites are actively 
trying to rank for them. This makes it significantly easier for a new website with low 
domain authority to achieve a high ranking on the first page of Google.
40 
● 
Higher Conversion Rates: The specificity of a long-tail query indicates a higher level of 
user intent. These users are not just looking for information; they are looking for a 
solution. Traffic from these keywords is more qualified and converts at a much higher rate 
than traffic from broad terms.

Influencer marketing involves paying or coopting people with large followings on social 
media to promote the brand and generate sales. The use of a well-known influencer 
like  Tara  McKenna  @zero.waste.collective  might  form  part  of  promoting  a  specific  
sustainability initiative.  
 
c) Content marketing 
This  involves  the  creation  and  placement  of  content,  often  purporting  to  be  articles,  
reviews, and think pieces, designed to highlight the brand’s advantages. Sustainability 
could well form part of a content marketing campaign.  
 
MEASURE THE RESULTS 
Marketers often find it difficult to quantify the results of their efforts, in large part because the 
success  of  any  marketing  campaign  is  integrally  bound  up  with  the  success  of  the  company’s  
products and business model. And even the most well-constructed marketing campaign may fail 
in the face of a more effective competitive campaign.  
 
The following will typically be used to measure progress: 
 
1. Sales and market share data 
Every company will have a measure of sales and market share that is used to track overall 
progress.  Data  may  be  limited  to  ex-factory  sales  or  shipments  but  more  often  the  
company will have access to some measure of competitive sales, e.g., audit of grocery store 
sales, audit of purchases from a panel of households, syndicated compilation of industry 
sales. 
 
2. Brand surveys 
A sample-based  measure  of  consumer  brand  awareness,  image,  and  purchase  intent.  
Conducted  periodically  or  run  continuously  over  time  to  better  examine  trends.  Often 
referred to as attitudinal data and generally considered inferior or diagnostic to behavioral 
data like sales. Questions may be included in studies to understand consumer awareness 
and  attitudes  of  the  brand’s  commitment  to  sustainability  or  specific  sustainability

New or small brands, on the other hand, are at a disadvantage. Even if they have a great product, 
one that is demonstrably better than the alternatives, they may not be well-known, and they are 
unlikely  to  have  widespread  distribution.  While  online  recommendation  engines,  customer  
reviews, and search have made it easier to find small and niche brands, lack of familiarity will still 
create a barrier to purchase. Even if someone wants to buy a small brand, they may not be able to 
find it in the store or want to order online, and default to buying an alternative. Particularly when 
a small brand is distributed through grocery stores or other third-party retailers, the brand is going 
to have to first prove that it can generate sales, then it can start to bootstrap its growth by ramping 
up its marketing spend and availability. 
 
The problem with many sustainable or eco-friendly brands is that they are often priced higher than 
the mainstream and tend to have smaller market shares, making them both less easy to mind and 
less easy to find.

2. 
The Sub-headline (or Short Paragraph): This element adds clarity and context. It 
should briefly explain what the product is, who it is for, and the key benefit it delivers. The 
crucial mistake to avoid here is listing features. Customers do not buy features; they buy 
better versions of themselves. The copy must translate technical capabilities into 
real-world benefits.
11
 For example, instead of stating, ""Our software integrates with over 
50 platforms,"" a benefit-focused approach would be, ""Streamline your workflow by 
connecting all your tools in one place"".
11
 The goal is to ditch the tech talk and make it 
crystal clear how the product will improve the customer's daily life.
11 
3. 
The Visual Element: A hero image, a short video, or an animated GIF should visually 
reinforce the message of the headline and sub-headline. It should show the product in 
action, delivering the promised benefit. A common mistake is using a visual that 
introduces unrelated features or distracting animations, which pulls attention away from 
the core message.
13
 The visual and the text must work in harmony to tell a single, 
coherent story. 
The ultimate test of a value proposition is its clarity and conciseness. A single sentence that 
packs a punch is far more effective than a paragraph of fluff.
11
 It must be clear enough for 
both humans and machines to understand, especially in an era of AI-generated product 

summaries.

The AI Translation Layer: Messaging for a Mixed Audience 
 
An AI SaaS product rarely has a monolithic audience. The user base for this MVP is a prime 
example, spanning from highly technical AI enthusiasts to non-technical business owners. A 
one-size-fits-all message is doomed to fail. To succeed, marketing communications must 
employ a ""Translation Layer,"" a strategic approach that adapts the core value proposition to 
the specific language, priorities, and pain points of each audience segment.

● 
For AI Enthusiasts and Developers: This audience is technically fluent and deeply 
skeptical of marketing hype. The messaging for them can and should be more technical. 
They want to understand the ""how"" behind the ""what.""

opposite was found to be the situation. The concept of pilot sites became fundamental to
the approach and to building empathy. In some situations, an MVP that worked well did
not necessarily meet the needs of a pilot site. In addition, an MVP that worked well in one
pilot site did not necessarily work as well in another. The word‘evaluate’was found to

OPTIMIZING FOR GROWTH – Building on your successes, it’s 
now  time  to  optimize  conversion  rates  at  all  possible  points.  Invest  
more money in channels that are generating the highest conversion 
rates. Become even more aggressive with A/B testing: conduct more 
tests, make the experiments finer-grained, and delve into a continuous 
improvement  cycle.  Evaluate  each  channel  in  the  context  of  your  
business  economics;  some  may  convert  well  but  cost  more.  Make  
sure you can afford each channel by comparing it with your CLV. 
Eliminate  any  channels  that  are  ROI  negative  over  the  customer  
lifetime,  and  shift  investment  into  those  that  are  ROI  positive  over  
the shortest timeframe. Your goal 
is  to  move  beyond  just  supplying  enough  leads,  maturing  so  as  to  
know which channels produce the best leads.
Exit  Criteria:  Organizations  can  exit  this  stage  when  they  know  
their top conversion channels and marketing assets, and know that 
money invested in these will produce more demand and profitable 
customers.
Timeframe: 6 – 12 months.
PREDICTING  GROWTH  –  With  known  top  channels  and  
conversion rates, you can predict future revenue based on marketing 
activity. Testing and optimization can continue, 
but  a  marketing  chief  should  invest  in  people  and  tools  having  a  
focus on metrics and reporting. 
Marketing  may  begin  to  scrutinize  churn  here,  putting  in  place  
programs to reduce it as much as possible. By this stage of  maturity, 
your ARR has become a big enough number that high (or growing) 
churn is a problem. To reduce it, marketing might invest more in 
a marketing function to improve customer satisfaction, or work with 
the  product  team  to  develop  features  that  increase  your  product’s

Brand And Product Portfolio 
A company may often own and market several brands in the same product category. The portfolio 
will  be  managed  and  marketed  to  maximize  sales.  Portfolios  might  address  specific  needs  or  
occasions, e.g., most automotive manufacturers will have a range of models designed for different

needs of the customer, creating products that are technically feasible, and sufficient
value is generated for the company.
Building onFigure 1and the context of Texuna, an MVP process map (Figure 2)was
developed. The MVP process map advocates a process that commences with gaining insights
from current or potential customers; this is the primary motivation for creating a new product
and forms the basis for developing the initial MVP. If the level of desirability is insufficient, then
the company must decide to either pivot the problem (by moving to an alternative problem)
or to end the exploratory phase completely. In most instances though, the desirability phase
reveals various problems that were not envisaged by the design team during the ideation
phase. Adding new features to the product, removing features not desired, or modifying
features that were problematic for users subsequently refine the MVP. This results in a new
version of the MVP and a second iteration of the evaluation process is required. This iterative
evaluation process is repeated until the MVP moves closer to the PMF. Once the PMF is
achieved, then evaluation is complete and a product launch is planned.
4. Lessons learned from adopting the MVP concept
The natural inclination of the Texuna Edtech Research Centre (ERC) team (and especially
those from a technical background) was to focus on questions of feasibility. They
needed to be redirected to questions of desirability and viability. The Director of
Research and Innovation (DRI) realised that the most likely failure points in the MVPs
would be issues of‘desirability’and‘viability’. For this reason, three circles of equal size
representing desirability, feasibility and viability were added to the MVP-PMF conceptual

framework. In order to highlight the importance of developing the MVP to address the
specific need of customers, the‘Empathise Step’was added. This placed a clear focus on
taking the time to understand the needs of the customer and the context in which they
would engage with the product.
The‘Evaluate-Pilot Step’initially included the word‘test’(Pilot Test Step). However, it
was observed that the word‘test’gave the impression that the value of the MVP could be

objectively judged in absolute terms through traditional software testing, whereas the
opposite was found to be the situation. The concept of pilot sites became fundamental to
the approach and to building empathy. In some situations, an MVP that worked well did
not necessarily meet the needs of a pilot site. In addition, an MVP that worked well in one
pilot site did not necessarily work as well in another. The word‘evaluate’was found to
better reflect the activity required to judge the relative value of the MVP.
Another interesting lesson was the natural instinct among some members of the
innovation team to delay the release of the MVP to pilot sites. There was a strong culture
within Texuna for delivering quality software and team members were often heard to judge
themselves by the quality of their outputs. Employees were therefore keen to perfect those
outputs before handing them over to pilot sites. In addition, MVPs were deemed by team
members to have been a‘failure’when they were less well-received by pilot sites even
though many insightful lessons may have been learned from their release. The natural
instinct was, therefore, for the MVPs to be seen as outputs rather than a means for learning–
the focus thereby gradually creeping away from learning towards quality.
The early release of MVPs contributed, at times, to low morale within the team.
The teams felt they were releasing low-quality outputs that had not been fully
developed or fully tested. The DRI had to consistently challenge this mindset and
in some cases, he decided to release MVPs to pilot sites (even when he himself had
some concerns about their quality) as he wished‘to send out a message to his own
team of the need for early customer involvement’.

The  big  challenge  is  making  sure  that  marketing  understands  how  sustainability  might  help  
improve brand sales now and in future. There is no doubt that it is becoming a more important 
issue for many, but how might your brand use it to gain competitive advantage today? And if it is 
not  a  major  issue  right  now,  how  might  your  brand  use  it  to  gain  competitive  advantage?  Your 
consumer insight team may already have data that shows how important sustainability issues are 
in  general  and  specifically  for  your  brand.  Get  hold  of  the  brand  plan  and  see  what  is  already  
planned. Are there obvious places that highlighting sustainability initiatives might help? 
 
Complete your assessment and then talk with the marketing team to see if there is any appetite 
for building your initiative into the marketing plan in some way. 
 
 

 
18 
IT IS ALWAYS GOOD TO TALK 
If you can, start at the top, because senior marketers will be most familiar with business trends 
and  issues,  and  are  less  likely  to  be  bogged  down  in  day-to-day  operations.  They  know  
sustainability  is  a  big  and  growing  issue  likely  to  affect  all  brands  and  will  be  looking  to  do  
something about it. However, it may be that younger members of the marketing team are more 
passionate about sustainability issues and will champion your cause within the team. 
 
Marketers are always on the lookout for a new way to promote their brand, improve its appeal, 
and drive sales. Like you, they may feel concerned about highlighting small scale initiatives that 
have yet to be widely adopted but the public will give credit for a company trying to do the right 
thing. Most  people  want  companies  to  do  the  right  thing  for  the  planet  and,  with  the  right  
communication, will reward a brand that can credibly claim to be making steps in that direction,

Can the product function without this feature? If the core value proposition collapses 
without it, it's essential. If it's an enhancement, it can wait. 
2. 
Does the target audience explicitly want this feature? This must be based on direct 
research and interviews, not assumptions.

Does this feature solve a critical, high-pain problem? The MVP must target a 
""hair-on-fire"" problem, not a minor inconvenience.

Will this feature have a significant impact on revenue? For a paid MVP, features that 
directly enable or justify the price are paramount.

12  THE SAAS MARKETING HANDBOOK / TIM MATTHEWS
PRODUCT/MARKET  FIT  –  Finding  buyers  who  want  your  
product is the goal of any business. SaaS is no different, except the 
online delivery  model affords  faster product changes.  During  this 
growth phase, the entire company needs to make whatever changes 
are required to make your product indispensable to an identified set 
of  buyers.  Marketing  should  focus  on  market  and  buyer  research,  
customer interviews, and competitive analysis during this stage. 
Exit  Criteria: A company can exit this phase when a significant 
percentage  of  customers  finds  the  product  indispensable  and 
marketing can identify the profile of an ideal customer.*
Timeframe: 6  –  18  months.  Some  companies  find  a  product/
market fit faster than others. Many need to significantly change the 
product—referred to as a “pivot”—at least once. Forbes ran a great 
article  about  business  pivots,  including  Twitter’s  transformation  
from  podcast  finder  to  microblogging  service,  and  PayPal’s  move 
from  beaming  payments  from  PDAs  (personal  digital  assistants,  or  
handheld computers) to helping eBay users pay sellers over the Web. 
Also,  the  more  complex  the  product,  the  longer  engineering  will  
need to built it (or rebuild it after a pivot).
EXPERIMENTING  FOR  GROWTH  –  Once  you  have  product  
market fit, determine the best way to reach your ideal customers. 
Marketing  should  focus  on  crystalizing  the  value  proposition,  as  
gleaned from discussions with existing customers. Close interaction 
with the sales team is really important—interview them, and also sit 
in on sales calls to learn what really resonates with customers. The 
team should also begin marketing via a few different channels, such 
as  Google  AdWords  and  sponsored  webinars,  and  do  some  rough  
A/B testing experiments to see what works best. The goal is to supply

administer high stake formative and summative examinations to students.
The university researchers, including two authors of this paper, were given full access
to the ERC and were embedded in the day-to-day activities of the innovation team for
a period of six months. During this time the frameworks emerged in tandem with the
adaptation of the Lean Start-up approach within the ERC. For instance, the student
evaluation platform was released as an MVP to a number of pilot sites (e.g. a private
education entity, a local university, a training unit in a global pharmaceutical company).
In addition, focus groups were held students, lecturers, administration and management
staff, as well as those participating in the pilots. During the focus groups, participants
interacted with the MVP and were presented with a number of questions. After the focus
groups, the pilot sites continued to use the MVPs and they provided daily feedback.
Online usability testing of the MVP was also organised. The insights from these activities
informed the evolution of the framework and process map presented in this paper.
3. The frameworks explained
This section presents two frameworks that can assist established companies to develop
MVPs.Figure 1represents the three overlapping criteria (desirability, feasibility, viability)
for a product to be successful and the iterative process between MVP and PMF.
The‘desirability’space develops the necessary collaboration with the stakeholders by
asking‘What do people desire?’and ultimately‘How do people decide on new products?’
A company needs to start by determining what would deliver value to the stakeholders.
The‘viability’space clarifies the answer to the question‘What is a sustainable business
model?’The‘feasibility’space considers‘What is technically and organisationally feasible?’
The solutions that emerge at the end of this iterative process should be positioned at
the intersection of these three dimensions (desirability, feasibility, and viability). It is here

MARKETING IS AN EVOLVING PRACTICE 
Marketing has been practiced in one form or another for millennia, but only evolved to influence 
mass-market consumer behavior following the Industrial Revolution. Since then, the practice has 
continued to evolve in response to changes in culture, media, and technology. The advent of TV 
and  then  the  Internet  have  marked  dramatic  transitions  in  the  practice  of  marketing,  and  
marketers  are  still  trying  to  figure  out  best  practices in  a  digital  world.  Marketing  theory  has  
evolved in  parallel, seeking  to  codify  the  principles  and  practices  of  marketing  and  drawing  on  
other areas of study such as behavioral economics and neuroscience.  
 
SUFFERING FROM A LACK OF CONSISTENCY 
Today, there is still debate in both professional and academic circles as to how marketing really 
works, and, unlike science or the law, the language of marketing is often ill-defined and open to 
interpretation. As a result, practitioners are free to create their own paradigm of how marketing 
works and what marketing activities will be most effective.

Direct Access: Providing a direct line to the founding team, such as a private Slack 
channel or exclusive Q&A sessions, makes them feel heard and valued.

● 
Influence on the Roadmap: Giving early adopters a genuine say in feature prioritization 
and product direction transforms them from passive users into active co-creators.

By carefully managing this narrative, the founder shifts the conversation from ""Please help me 
test my app for free"" to ""I'm offering you a unique opportunity to be part of something new 
and valuable."" This is the foundational positioning required to ask for payment with 
confidence. 
 
Validating the Problem and the Price Point Simultaneously 
 
A common pitfall for founders is to treat problem validation and pricing as two separate, 
sequential steps. They first confirm that a problem exists and then, much later, try to attach a 
price to their solution. This is a flawed approach. For a paid MVP, the central business 
hypothesis is not merely ""Does this solve a problem?"" but ""Does this solve a problem that 
people will pay to have solved?"".
1
 Therefore, these two validation streams must be concurrent 
from the very first interaction with a potential customer. 
The validation process begins long before a single line of code is written. It starts with 
conversations. The initial goal is to conduct 10-15 casual, exploratory interviews with 

individuals who fit the ideal customer profile.
2
 The purpose of these conversations is not to 
pitch a solution but to deeply understand the problem space. However, it's crucial to go 
beyond simply identifying pain points. A user might describe a problem as severe, but if their 
current workaround is free and ""good enough,"" their willingness to pay for a new solution will 
be minimal. 
To bridge this gap, the validation interviews must be designed to uncover the economic and 
emotional cost of the problem. The questioning framework should evolve: 
● 
From: ""Is [problem X] a challenge for you?"" 
● 
To: ""Tell me about the last time you dealt with [problem X]. What was that process like?"" 
● 
From: ""Would a tool that does be useful?"" 
● 
To: ""What have you tried in the past to solve [problem X]? What did you like or dislike 
about those solutions?"" 
● 
And most critically: ""What have you spent—in terms of time, money, or other 
resources—trying to manage this problem?"" and ""If you could wave a magic wand and 
make this problem disappear, what would that be worth to you on a monthly basis?"".
10 
The answers to these latter questions are gold. They provide a direct anchor for the product's 
value. If a potential customer reveals they waste 10 hours a month on a task and their time is 
worth $100 an hour, a $1,000 problem has been identified. This creates a powerful 
foundation for a value-based pricing discussion. 
After confirming the problem's existence and its perceived cost, the next step is to test the 
proposed solution. This does not require a working product. A simple landing page, a slide 
deck, or even a hand-drawn sketch of the user interface can be presented to a different set of 
5-10 potential users.
2
 The pitch is simple: ""We are building a tool to solve [problem X]. This is 
how it will work. Based on what you see, is this something you would be willing to pay for?"" 
This creates a ""Value-Validation Loop."" The insights from the problem-cost interviews directly 
inform the pricing strategy (e.g., Pilot Pricing or Value-Based Pricing), which is then tested 
with the solution mockups.
7
 This iterative process ensures that by the time the MVP is ready 
for launch, the price is not an arbitrary number pulled from thin air but a figure that is already 
validated and anchored to the customer's own perception of the problem's cost. This makes 
the eventual sales conversation feel logical and fair, dramatically increasing the likelihood of 
converting those first crucial paying customers. 
 
Chapter 2: Crafting a High-Resonance Value Proposition for AI 
 
In the crowded SaaS marketplace, a compelling value proposition is the hook that captures 
attention and differentiates a product from a sea of ""me too"" solutions.
11
 For an AI-based 

SaaS, this challenge is amplified. The term ""AI"" itself is both a powerful buzzword and a 
source of confusion, skepticism, and fear. A successful value proposition must therefore not 
only communicate the product's core benefit but also translate the complexity of AI into 
tangible, desirable outcomes for a diverse audience. This chapter provides a tactical 
framework for building a message that resonates with everyone from deep-learning engineers 
to privacy-conscious small business owners.

industry.  Consumer-facing  goods  like  soft  drinks  are  highly  dependent  on  their  brand,  because  
they  serve  a  generic  need  for  refreshment  and  brand  choice  often  comes  down  to  habit  and  
intuitive  choices.  IT  infrastructure  companies  are  far  more  dependent  on  their  IP  and  technical  
expertise than their brand because customer needs are more complex, varied and the purchase 
process  is  more  deliberative.  Unfortunately,  businesses  engaged  in  primary  resource  extraction  
are probably least reliant on their brand to generate financial value.  
 
MOST MARKETERS ARE SEEKING MARKET SHARE GROWTH 
A brand may grow because sales of the category are growing, but overall sales in most categories 
are flat. In that case, to grow sales, brands must compete for market share – the proportion of 
total category sales they account for. However, there are two basic classifications of market share: 
volume and value. The first represents a share of units sold and the second is weighted by price. 
Importantly, the latter is predictive of profit and brand value.  
 
Given  that  measuring  brand  value  is  a  complex  and  time-consuming  business,  most  marketers  
default to using market share as a proxy for financial value. However, too often the default is to 
use volume market share because it is simpler. Unfortunately, this prioritizes unprofitable growth

also include an inbound phone call, chat, or contact request, which 
are usually the hottest leads.
Sales-accepted lead (SAL) – At the SAL stage, sales acknowledges 
that an MQL meets the agreed-upon criteria and agrees to work it. 
SALs demark the handoff from marketing to sales. Sales can reject 
leads that are incomplete or that they’re already working. Just as the 
criteria being met are important to sales, an agreement to follow up 
within  a  prescribed  timeframe  is  important  to  marketing  so  that  a  
qualified lead doesn’t go cold.
Sales-qualified  lead  (SQL)  –  A  SQL  involves  a  decision  by  
sales, after additional qualification via discussions with the potential 
buyer, that a sales opportunity, having both a timeframe and budget, 
exists. Leads at this point are commonly referred to as opportunities. 
Upgrades,  upsells,  and  cross-sells  to  existing  customers  are  also  
called  opportunities.  These  may  not  come  all  the  way  through  the  
conversion funnel (Figure 1), depending on whether the opportunity 
was  created  via  a  marketing  promotion  to  existing  customers,for  
example, or through a conversation with a customer success rep or 
salesperson.
Customer  –  Once  a  deal  is  closed,  the  lead  has  become  closed  
business,  better  known  as  a  customer.  Existing  customers  can,  of  
course, become leads again for the purchase of  additional products 
or  services.  In  a  SaaS  business,  retaining  customers  is  critically  
important  because  monthy  or  annual  subscription  fees  are  such  a  
large part of  overall revenue. 
Lost  Lead,  or  Lost  Business  –  You  can’t  win  them  all.  I  
recommend tracking lost leads. Not only can you do win/loss analysis, 
but oftentimes lost leads can be put back into a nurturing queue—if  
the reason for the loss indicates they may be a qualified lead again 
in the future. For example, you may add a feature that the prospect 
was initially looking for and now let them know it’s available. If  they 
didn’t end up purchasing a competing product, or are dissatisfied

Every brand will gain and lose customers over time and marketing’s job is to help ensure that the 
gains  outweigh  the  losses.  Additionally,  some  companies  will  focus  on  developing  new  
consumption  occasions  or  reducing  price  elasticity  (making  sales  less  responsive  to  changes  in  
price, which should help improve profits). 
 
MARKETING AMPLIFIES BRAND VALUE 
The  effect  of  marketing  is  not  independent  of  the  brand  and  product  being  advertised.  As  
advertising guru David Ogilvy is reputed to have said, “Great marketing only makes a bad product 
fail faster.” What marketing does is amplify what the brand offers and stands for. 
 
Marketing aims to ensure that people will think of the brand when it comes time for them to buy, 
and  by  improving  the  saleability  of  a  brand,  marketing  helps  increase  the  number  of  sales  than  
would have been made otherwise. 
 
MARKETING IS A SHARE GAME 
Marketing  is  inherently  competitive,  a  zero-sum  game.  As  noted  above,  one  of  the  key  metrics  
marketers pay attention to is market share. Market share is based on sales, but depending on the 
product  category  and  marketing  task,  brands  may  also  compete  for  share  of  wallet,  e.g.,  a  
proportion of someone’s disposable income, share of throat, e.g., the proportion of total beverage 
consumption, or share of occasion, e.g., the proportion of breakfast sales. 
 
MARKETING SUCCESS OFTEN REQUIRES A TRIPLE WIN 
Consumer-focused  companies  that  must  work  through  retailers  will  have  to  do  more  than  just  
please  end-consumers.  Retailers  often  prioritize  growing  category  sales  rather  than  sales  of  a  
specific  brand,  so  marketers  must  ensure  that  any  marketing  campaign  is  expected  to  increase  
overall category sales. So, a successful campaign likely needs to take account of the needs of the 
brand owner, the retailer, and the shopper.  
 
THE MARKETING MIX REFERS TO THE BASIC GROWTH LEVERS 
The  marketing  mix  is  composed  of  the  basic  levers  that  marketing  can  use  to  drive  sales.  Often 
referred to as the 4P’s: product, price, place, and promotion. 
 

 
9 
HOW THE 4PS INFLUENCE SALES & BRAND VALUE 
 
Over the years various other P’s have been proposed, notably including people – to encompass 
the importance of customer service and employee commitment – packaging –  obviously important 
to products sold on grocery shelves - and purpose – more on this below.  
 
MARKETING’S RESPONSIBILITY VARIES BY COMPANY 
The degree to which marketing directly controls or is involved with any P apart from promotion 
will  vary  by  industry  and  company. In  consumer-focused  companies,  marketing  will  likely  be  
involved with all four, from identifying a consumer need that could be satisfied, helping to design 
the  product,  then  figuring  out  how  to  price  it,  where  to  sell  it  and  how  best  to  promote  it.  A  
company  like  Diageo,  selling  brands  like  Johnnie  Walker,  Guinness,  and  Smirnoff,  regards  its  
brands  as  critical  to  growing  sales  and  profits.  As  a  result,  marketing  has  more  control  over  all

Claim: 
 Without capture, spikes decay. Converting 15–30% of viral traffic into an owned channel 
multiplies ROI. 
Evidence: 
 Research from PLG companies shows sign-up friction is the #1 leak in viral funnels; single-click 
signup improves conversion by 22–35%. 
Reasoning: 
 Eyeballs are cheap; relationships compound. Guerrilla success = awareness converted into an 
addressable audience.

The‘desirability’space develops the necessary collaboration with the stakeholders by
asking‘What do people desire?’and ultimately‘How do people decide on new products?’
A company needs to start by determining what would deliver value to the stakeholders.
The‘viability’space clarifies the answer to the question‘What is a sustainable business

The solutions that emerge at the end of this iterative process should be positioned at

ABSTRACT
The minimum viable product (MVP) is a fundamental concept
of the Lean Start-up approach as it enables a company to
quickly start the learning process by integrating feedback
from early adopters. Although the MVP concept has evolved
over the years, its application is most often reported in a start-
up context, even though established companies struggle to
develop MVPs. This study reports on the experience and les-
sons learned at Texuna, an established company, where the
software product innovation team created a process map for
developingMVPs.Thisisthefirst study that allows the original
MVP approach to be extended and applied to established
organisations.

1. Introduction
The Lean Start-up approach has been promoted as a way to nurture product
innovation in established companies (Märijärvi et al.,2016). The Lean Start-up
approach has received some attention from established companies including 3M,

Writing for Developers: Clarity, Accuracy, and No Fluff 
 
When creating content for a technical audience, the writing style must be adapted to their 
expectations. This audience values efficiency, precision, and authenticity above all else. 
● 
Clarity and Conciseness: Use clear, direct language. Write in an active voice with short 
sentences. While it's important to avoid unnecessary jargon that could alienate parts of 
the audience, using industry-specific terminology correctly is crucial for establishing 
credibility.
32
 A glossary of terms can be a helpful resource to maintain consistency and 
assist less technical readers.

● 
Logical Structure: Content must be logically organized and easy to navigate. Use clear 
headings, subheadings, bullet points, and numbered lists to break down complex 
information into digestible chunks. A well-structured article allows a busy developer to

for  the  sales  department,  SDRs  receive  MQLs  and  further  
qualify  them.  Typically  when  an  MQL  has  been  qualified 
to  a  certain  stage,  or  the  potential  customer  has  agreed  to  a  
sales  call,  the  MQL  is  passed  to  a  sales  representative.  SDR  
goals are based on qualified leads or appointments set, not a 
product sales quota.
• Inside Sales Representative (ISR) – A sales representative 
working on the phone. In some companies, ISRs handle lower-
end customers or smaller deal sizes, so have lower quotas. For 
certain products, ISRs can work all of  your deals.
 In a no-touch model, you do not need account managers, and may or may not need ISRs.

• Account Manager – A salesperson who meets customers at 
the latter’s offices. Account executives are paid more, generally 
have higher quotas, and work deals over a certain amount—
typically $25K – $50K and above.
• Customer  Success  Manager  (CSM)  –  Some  SaaS  
companies have created this new position, which is part sales 
engineer, part product consultant, and part customer service. 
A  CSM  works  inside,  much  like  a  customer  support  rep,  
but  may  use  a  tool  to  monitor  the  progress  of  customers  to  
proactively  drive  successful  onboarding,  rollout,  and  product  
adoption. Strictly speaking, a CSM is not in a sales role, but
