My parents just told me they want to start contributing to college funds for my kids, and I had to admit that I... haven't actually opened the accounts yet. My daughter is 7 and my son is 5. I know I should have done this years ago. All my coworkers talk about their kids' 529s like it's just something you do automatically, and here I am, supposedly good with money, and I've just been paralyzed about it. I kept telling myself I'd research the best options, then I'd get overwhelmed by all the state tax implications and investment choices, and then I'd feel guilty and avoid it altogether. Now my parents are ready to help and I don't even have the accounts set up. I feel like I've already failed my kids before they even get to high school.",

My wife and I have been setting aside money in a regular savings account, but I know that's not optimal. When my parents brought it up last week, I felt this wave of shame—like they were going to judge me for not having my act together. But they were actually just excited to help. I guess my question is: how do I move forward now? Can my parents contribute before I even open the accounts? And how much damage have I done by waiting this long?",
