After years of avoidance, you've found the courage to face this honestly. That takes real strength, and it's actually the hardest step in this entire process.\\n\\nHere's what I need you to understand: there is no universal timeline for mortgage payoff. Your friends' situations are completely different from yours - different purchase prices, different down payments, different life circumstances, different priorities. Comparing your chapter 12 to someone else's chapter 20 will only create unnecessary pain.\\n\\nAnd to answer your question directly: yes, it is absolutely possible to accelerate your mortgage payoff from here. At 38 with 23 years remaining, you potentially have decades of earning power ahead of you. You haven't wasted time - you've been living your life, and now you're ready to be intentional about this goal. That's not failure; that's growth.\\n\\nBefore we talk strategy, I want to understand your full picture.
