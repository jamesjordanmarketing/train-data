# ✅ PROMPT 6 - PART 1: COMPLETE

**Status:** Successfully Implemented  
**Date:** October 10, 2025  
**Time Taken:** ~1 hour  
**Phase:** Workflow Integration (Part 1 of 3)

---

## 🎯 What Was Built

### 1. Workflow Navigation Utilities ✅
**File:** `src/lib/workflow-navigation.ts` (NEW)

6 utility functions for workflow integration:
- `getWorkflowStage()` - Determines workflow stage
- `isReadyForWorkflow()` - Checks document readiness
- `getWorkflowUrl()` - Generates navigation URLs
- `getWorkflowReadinessMessage()` - Status messages
- `getWorkflowReadyDocuments()` - Bulk filtering
- `getNextActionLabel()` - Dynamic button labels

### 2. Document Source Distinction ✅
**File:** `src/components/client/DocumentSelectorClient.tsx` (MODIFIED)

- Added "Uploaded" badge for documents with files
- Badge appears in document metadata row
- Distinguishes uploaded files from seed data
- Gray secondary styling, subtle appearance

### 3. Source Filter ✅
**File:** `src/components/client/DocumentSelectorClient.tsx` (MODIFIED)

New filter dropdown with three options:
- "All Sources" - Shows everything
- "Uploaded Only" - Only documents with files
- "Seed Data Only" - Only database seed documents

Works in combination with search and status filters.

### 4. Convenience Exports ✅
**File:** `src/components/DocumentSelector.tsx` (MODIFIED)

Re-exports for easier imports:
```typescript
export { DocumentSelectorServer as DocumentSelector }
export { DocumentSelectorClient }
```

## 🚀 How to Test

### Quick Test (5 minutes)

1. **Start dev server**
   ```bash
   cd src
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Navigate to dashboard**
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/dashboard
   ```

3. **Verify source filter**
   - Look for new "Filter by Source" dropdown
   - Select "All Sources" / "Uploaded Only" / "Seed Data Only"
   - Verify filtering works

4. **Verify uploaded badge**
   - Find an uploaded document (if any exist)
   - Look for gray "Uploaded" badge in metadata row
   - Verify seed documents don't have badge

5. **Test combined filters**
   - Try search + status + source filters together
   - Verify all work in combination

### Expected Results

- ✅ Source filter dropdown appears
- ✅ Three filter options available
- ✅ "Uploaded" badge on uploaded documents
- ✅ No badge on seed documents
- ✅ Filters work correctly
- ✅ No console errors

## 🔄 Next Steps

### Ready for Part 2

**PROMPT6_b.md will add:**
- "Start Workflow" button on upload page
- Workflow action buttons in upload queue
- Navigation from upload → workflow
- Document status-based actions

**Will use utilities from Part 1:**
- `getWorkflowUrl()` - For button navigation
- `isReadyForWorkflow()` - To enable/disable buttons
- `getNextActionLabel()` - For button text
- `getWorkflowReadinessMessage()` - For tooltips

---

## 📞 Troubleshooting

### No Source Filter Appears
- Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R
- Restart dev server
- Clear browser cache

### No "Uploaded" Badge
- Check if uploaded documents exist
- Upload a document via `/upload` first
- Wait for processing to complete

### Filter Shows No Results
- Check document status in upload queue
- Ensure documents completed processing
- Verify file_path exists in database
