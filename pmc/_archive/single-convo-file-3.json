My parents just told me they want to start contributing to college funds for my kids, and I had to admit that I... haven't actually opened the accounts yet. My daughter is 7 and my son is 5. I know I should have done this years ago. All my coworkers talk about their kids' 529s like it's just something you do automatically, and here I am, supposedly good with money, and I've just been paralyzed about it. I kept telling myself I'd research the best options, then I'd get overwhelmed by all the state tax implications and investment choices, and then I'd feel guilty and avoid it altogether. Now my parents are ready to help and I don't even have the accounts set up. I feel like I've already failed my kids before they even get to high school.",
