FIRST we need to architect and complete the full version of the FINAL JSON and JSONL formats that will be ACTUAL LoRA Training Files.  
We have the current "Enriched JSON" which captures one conversation EXAMPLE. 

So the first thing we need to do is update the `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\train-data\pmc\context-ai\pmct\training-data-seeds\c-alpha-build_v3.4_emotional-dataset-JSON-format_v3.json` schema format to include the new very important scaffolding, parameters, metadata. You can see the details of the implementation here: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\train-data\pmc\context-ai\pmct\iteration-2-json-updated_v1.md`

You can also see 5 implemented files here: 
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\train-data\pmc\_archive\david-chen-confusion-clarity-mortgage-enriched-scaffolds.json`
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\train-data\pmc\_archive\jennifer-confusion-clarity-mortgage-enriched-scaffolds.json`
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\train-data\pmc\_archive\jennifer-overwhelm-to-empowerment-estate-plannin-scaffolds.json`
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\train-data\pmc\_archive\marcus-chen-overwhelm-to-empowerment-estate-plannin-scaffolds.json`
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\train-data\pmc\_archive\marcus-chen-overwhelm-to-empowerment-estate-plannin-scaffolds.json`

Read enough of all of these files to be confident you have the breadth of type of values and any "optional" elements that do not appear in all files (I don't think there are any "optional" elements" but I am not sure.

You can write the new version of the schema to: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\train-data\pmc\context-ai\pmct\training-data-seeds\c-alpha-build_v3.4_emotional-dataset-JSON-format_v4.json`

We also need to build on top of the new `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\train-data\pmc\context-ai\pmct\training-data-seeds\c-alpha-build_v3.4_emotional-dataset-JSON-format_v4.json` to build two new schemas:

1. LoRA Training Full Training File Format.
I will ask you, as the senior LoRA XML file architect to build new complete schema for:

a. The full training file that can contain thousands of collected conversations.
b. The full training file that can contain thousands of collected conversations, in a JSONL format

Keep in mind that:
1. These full files will be used for LoRA training.
2. These full files will have each of the "Enriched JSON" files (EXAMPLES) added to the full training files.
3. I want these production full files to be designed to be among the most effective LoRA training formats in the industry. Do not fill it with more information than we already have (see examples) but design the XML to be very effective at training models.


So your job in this prompt is to:
1. Add the new categories and elements to the existing individual conversation JSON schema. Put the new schema here: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\train-data\pmc\context-ai\pmct\training-data-seeds\c-alpha-build_v3.4_emotional-dataset-individual-JSON-format_v4.json`

2. Create the two new "Full" schemas that have the new updates and also have been upgraded to be among the most effective LoRA training formats in the industry. Do not add elements or categories we don't already have. Put those new format schemas here:
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\train-data\pmc\context-ai\pmct\training-data-seeds\c-alpha-build_v3.4_emotional-dataset-full-JSON-format_v4.json`
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\train-data\pmc\context-ai\pmct\training-data-seeds\c-alpha-build_v3.4_emotional-dataset-full-JSON-format_v4.jsonl`

3. Create an example full file as proof that the "full" schema format is accurate, precise, and capable of mapping multiple conversations in one file. 
Put the example new full file here: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\train-data\pmc\context-ai\pmct\training-data-seeds\c-alpha-build_v3.4_emotional-dataset-JSON-example_v4.json`
