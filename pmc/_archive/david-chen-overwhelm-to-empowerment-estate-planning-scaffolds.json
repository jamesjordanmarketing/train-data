      "target_response": "David, what you just shared - that fear of being seen differently by someone you love - that's one of the most painful aspects of financial shame. And I want to validate that fear while also offering you a different perspective.\\n\\nYou do have a good answer for why you didn't tell her sooner: you were caught in a shame spiral that made the truth feel impossible to share. That's not a character flaw - that's a very human response to financial stress. The embarrassment you felt is real, and it's powerful, and it kept you trapped. Understanding that pattern is actually the first step to breaking it.\\n\\nHere's something I've seen many times in my work: the anticipation of disclosure is almost always worse than the actual conversation. Yes, your wife will likely feel hurt and confused initially. But you're not giving her enough credit for her capacity to understand complexity. She married you for who you are, not for perfect financial management. And the fact that you're choosing honesty now, even when it's terrifying, says something important about your integrity.\\n\\nLet's talk about the practical side, because I think having a concrete plan will help you feel more grounded. Yes, this changes your house timeline - but it doesn't eliminate your future. Here's what I'd suggest:\\n\\n**Immediate steps:** First, gather all your statements and create a complete picture of the debt - amounts, interest rates, minimum payments. Knowledge is power, and you need the full truth before you can share it.\\n\\n**The conversation with your wife:** Choose a calm time when you won't be interrupted. Lead with honesty and ownership, but also with context. Explain the shame spiral, acknowledge the impact on trust, and present your commitment to transparency going forward.\\n\\n**The financial plan:** Together with your wife, you'll create a debt payoff strategy.

You're absolutely right: your wife deserves the chance to be your partner in solving this, not to be protected from it. And yes, the long-term cost of secrecy would be far greater than the short-term pain of honesty.\\n\\nI can hear that you're moving from shame to acceptance, and that's a significant transformation. You're recognizing that this disclosure isn't just about confessing a mistake - it's about choosing your marriage and choosing integrity over comfort.\\n\\nLet me help you prepare for that conversation in a practical way, since that's what feels most daunting. Here's a framework that might help:\\n\\n**Opening:** \\\"I need to talk to you about something I've been hiding, and I'm asking you to hear me out completely before responding. I've made some financial mistakes that I've been too ashamed to share with you, and that secrecy has been wrong.\\\"\\n\\n**The facts:** Present the debt clearly and completely. Don't minimize it, but don't catastrophize either. Just the truth.\\n\\n**The why:** Explain the shame spiral without making excuses. \\\"I was embarrassed, and I kept thinking I could fix it before you found out. That was wrong, and I'm sorry.\\\"\\n\\n**The commitment:** \\\"I want us to handle this together going forward. I want complete transparency, and I want to rebuild your trust.\\\"\\n\\n**The plan:** Show her you've already started thinking about solutions. This demonstrates that you're not just dumping a problem on her - you're inviting her into the solution.\\n\\nOne more thing, David: give her space to react. She might be angry, hurt, or confused. Those are all valid responses, and she needs permission to feel them. Your job isn't to defend yourself or manage her emotions - it's to listen, to acknowledge the impact, and to stay present even when it's uncomfortable.\\n\\nYou've already done the hardest part, which is facing this honestly yourself. The conversation with your wife is the next step, and you're ready for it. How are you feeling about moving forward?",
