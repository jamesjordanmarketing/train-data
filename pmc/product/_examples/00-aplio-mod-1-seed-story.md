## 1 Product Vision

### What are we building?
A strategic modernization of the Aplio Design System Theme, transforming its JavaScript implementation into a TypeScript-powered Next.js 14 platform. This upgrade focuses on migrating the Home 4 template (https://js-aplio-6.vercel.app/home-4) as our flagship demonstration, preserving Aplio's premium design aesthetics while implementing modern architectural patterns and development practices.

### Core Value Proposition
