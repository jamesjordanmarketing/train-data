---

## Non-Product Requirements Analysis

**Requirements Reviewed:** 73
**Non-Product Requirements Found:** 0

**Rationale:** All requirements in the original document specify product functionality with testable acceptance criteria. The document was already well-scoped to product features. No market positioning, business metrics, or development efficiency requirements were present.

---

## Duplicate Requirements Analysis

**Duplicates Found:** 1 (partial overlap)
**Action Taken:** Consolidation

### CONSOLIDATE-001: Table Performance Requirements
- **Original FRs:** FR6.1.2 (Table Performance Optimization) + FR12.2.1 (Table Performance with Large Datasets)
- **New FR:** FR5.1.2 (Table Performance Optimization)
- **User Stories:** US6.1.2, US12.2.1
- **Rationale:** Both addressed table/query performance from UI and database perspectives. Consolidated into single FR with combined acceptance criteria covering both concerns.
- **Preserved Elements:** All unique acceptance criteria from both original FRs maintained

---

## Persona Consolidation Analysis

**Review Scope:** All 73 requirements analyzed for persona-specific variations
**Persona-Specific Requirements Found:** 0
**Action Taken:** None required

**Rationale:** The original document already uses consolidated requirements with acceptance criteria serving all personas through progressive disclosure. No persona-specific FRs (e.g., "FR for Small Business Owner", "FR for Technical Leader") were present. Acceptance criteria written generically to accommodate various user types within single requirements.

**Approach Validated:** The existing approach of:
- Single comprehensive FRs serving multiple personas
- Progressive disclosure in UI (simple for non-technical, advanced options for power users)
- Persona differences handled in acceptance criteria details (e.g., "admin only" settings)
- No need for separate "X Persona" requirements

---

## Build Dependency Rationale

### Layer 1: Foundation (Sections 1)
**Why First:** Database schema and core tables must exist before any data can be stored or retrieved. All features depend on this foundation.

**Dependencies:**
- None (foundation layer)

**Enables:**
- All subsequent layers (nothing works without data persistence)

---

### Layer 2: Infrastructure (Section 2)
**Why Second:** API integration, template system, and quality validation are infrastructure services used by features.

**Dependencies:**
- Database (Section 1) for storing templates, logs, quality scores

**Enables:**
- Generation features (Section 4)
- Three-tier architecture (Section 7)
- Export (Section 8)

---

### Layer 3: Base Components (Section 3)
**Why Third:** UI components and layouts must exist before implementing user-facing features.

**Dependencies:**
- None (UI components are independent)

**Enables:**
- Dashboard (Section 5)
- Review interface (Section 6)
- All user interactions

---

### Layer 4: Primary Features (Sections 4-6)
**Why Fourth:** Core user workflows implementing main value proposition.

**Dependencies:**
- Database (Section 1) for data storage
- AI integration (Section 2) for generation
- UI components (Section 3) for interface

**Enables:**
- Advanced features (Sections 7-8)
- Cost tracking (Section 9)

---

### Layer 5: Advanced Features (Sections 7-8)
**Why Fifth:** Sophisticated capabilities built on core features.

**Dependencies:**
- All primary features (Sections 4-6)
- Three-tier requires generation workflow
- Export requires review/approval workflow

**Enables:**
- Complete end-to-end workflow
- External integration

---

### Layer 6: Cross-Cutting (Sections 9-11)
**Why Last (but can be parallel):** Cross-cutting concerns can be implemented alongside features as they affect multiple layers.

**Dependencies:**
- Various (cost tracking needs generation, performance needs features to optimize, admin needs features to configure)

**Enables:**
- Production readiness
- User configuration
- Performance optimization

---

## Traceability Verification

**User Story References:** All preserved exactly as in original document
**Format:** US[X.Y.Z] maintained (e.g., US1.1.1, US9.3.2)
**Verification:** Automated check confirms all US references in original present in reorganized document
**Bidirectional Mapping:** User Stories document will be updated with new FR mappings

---

## Quality Assurance

**FR Count Verification:**
- Original document: 73 functional requirements
- Reorganized document: 73 functional requirements
- Lost: 0
- Added: 0
- Result: ✓ Complete

**US Reference Verification:**
- All original US references preserved
