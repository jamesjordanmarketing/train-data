# Product Stories

## Purpose
This directory contains human-written product specifications and stories that serve as the initial input for Project Memory Core (PMC) initialization. These documents are the raw, unstructured starting point from which PMC generates structured project documentation.

## Contents
- Raw product specifications (e.g., `detailed14b.txt`)
- Feature stories
- Technical requirements documents
- Initial project vision documents

## Usage
1. Place your human-written product specification in this directory
2. Use the PMC initialization scripts to convert this raw input into structured documentation
3. The original document remains here as a reference and source of truth

## File Format
While there's no strict format requirement for these documents, they should typically include:
- Project objectives
- Feature requirements
- Technical requirements
- Constraints and limitations
- Target user information
- Business context

## Relationship to PMC
These documents are:
- Input for PMC initialization
- Source material for generated documentation
- Reference for validation
- Historical record of original requirements

## Best Practices
1. Keep original files unchanged
2. Use clear, descriptive filenames
3. Include creation date in filename or content
4. Maintain version history if document evolves
5. Reference these files in PMC documentation

## Notes
- These are not templates
- These are not auto-generated
- These should be preserved in their original form
- These serve as the foundation for PMC initialization
