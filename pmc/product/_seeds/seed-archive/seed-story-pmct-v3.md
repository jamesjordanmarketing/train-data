# Project Memory Core - Tracking (PMCT) Product Overview

## Product Summary & Value Proposition

Project Memory Core Tracking (PMCT) is a sophisticated project tracking system designed to bridge the critical gap between AI agents and human project managers. It serves as an intelligent project monitoring and reporting platform that caters to both artificial and human intelligence needs simultaneously.

The system's core value lies in its ability to maintain comprehensive historical context while generating human-readable reports, enabling AI agents to make data-driven decisions while providing project managers with clear visibility into project health and progress. By creating and maintaining living documents that evolve with the project, PMCT ensures no critical information is lost while maintaining clear project visibility at all levels.
