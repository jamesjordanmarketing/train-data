1  THE SAAS MARKETING HANDBOOK / TIM MATTHEWS
Software-as-a-Service  (SaaS)  is  a  means  of  delivering  software  
to  customers  over  the  Internet,  removing  the  need  to  install  and  
maintain  software  on  hardware  servers  owned  by  customers.  The  
delivery model has two important ramifications for SaaS businesses. 
First,  it  removes  technical  and  budgeting  obstacles  to  a  sale;  
customers  can  directly  test  and  purchase  software  without  lengthy  
hardware  procurement  and  software  configuration.  Second,  since 
SaaS is sold as a subscription, SaaS companies can grow quickly as 
existing customers renew their subscriptions and an equal or greater 
number of  new customers is acquired. 
Both  the  change  in  buyer  behavior  and  subscription  pricing  have  
specific impacts on your marketing department. SaaS puts even more 
of  the  buying  cycle  into  the  hands  of  marketing.  With  SaaS,  buyers  
research a product, and often try it out,  before even speaking to a sales 
person. Most buyers now expect to find the price of the SaaS product 
on the website. SaaS marketers need to take this change in the buyer 
journey into account when formulating a marketing strategy. 
Because  marketing  will  be  shouldering  more  of  the  load,  the  
department’s focus on metrics is critical. SaaS company CEOs will 
now  look  to  the  VP  of  sales  and  the  VP  of  marketing  for  business  
growth  forecasting.  The  sales/marketing  blame  game  won’t  cut  it  
anymore. SaaS is a numbers game, and marketers need to be more 
metrics-oriented than ever before.
THE WORLD OF SAAS
The SaaS ramp that started it all

2  THE SAAS MARKETING HANDBOOK / TIM MATTHEWS
A  successful  SaaS  business  reaches  the  nirvana  that  I  call  the  
SaaS  ramp.  With  good  execution,  the  majority  of  your  customers  
renewing every year, and the same sales force and marketing budget, 
you should be able to double revenue (all of  last year plus the same 
for this year), with your revenue line looking like a nice steep ramp. 
Improve your marketing and sales force growth and you can increase 
the slope and make it even steeper.
The  strategies  described  here  are  not  limited  to  SaaS;  they  apply  
to  any  subscription  business.  Marketers  promoting  a  platform  or  
infrastructure  as  a  service  (IaaS  and  PaaS,  respectively)  can  make  
use  of  the  techniques  described  in  this  eBook—likewise  for  those  
who sell cloud applications. The buyer and unit of  licensing (per user 
versus per gigabyte or per instance) will change, but the techniques, 
or  acquisition  and  retention,  are  fundamentally  the  same.  Acquire  
customers as quickly and cheaply as possible, and hang on to them 
for as long as you can.
The  SaaS  Marketing  Handbook  begins  by  dispelling  a  few  myths  that  
could  stand  in  the  way  of  good  execution.  The  guide  then  starts  
with  the  basics—the  very  particular  language  of  SaaS  marketing  
that  allows  you  to  take  part  in  planning  discussions  and  keep  up  
with  the  conversation.  Readers  having  SaaS  product  selling  or  
marketing  experience  can  skim  or  skip  ahead  to  the  The  Roadmap  
to  SaaS  Marketing  Maturity  section.  Setting  a  strategy  for  customer  
acquisition  and  selecting  the  right  sales  model  is  next,  followed  by  
building a funnel and measuring demand, and then on to techniques 
for building demand. The final sections deal with management and 
company boards, and making sure you avoid common pitfalls while 
setting appropriate expectations on timing, goals, and budget. 

3  THE SAAS MARKETING HANDBOOK / TIM MATTHEWS
Like  any  business  model  that  has  made  billions  for  executives  and  
shareholders,  SaaS  has  its  own  mythology.  Stories  heard  in  the  
boardrooms of  SaaS titans have been passed down to aspiring SaaS 
CEOs. Ambitious CMOs who want a piece of  the SaaS game often 
embellish their conversation stats—which is to say, be wary of  SaaS 
war stories. Make sure to separate history from lore. Here are four 
common SaaS marketing myths dispelled. Read these first lest ye be 
burned.
MYTH I — IT’S CHEAP  
Reality – People are the most expensive components of  the marketing 
mix, and it takes more people and more work to acquire customers 
in  a  SaaS  model.  The  amount  of  content  required,  frequency  of  
changes  made  to  your  websites  and  microsites,  and  the  collection  
and analysis of data all take significant manpower and expense. Just 
look at the IPO registration filings of young SaaS companies and 
you’ll see just how much it costs. In fact, it can be several times the 
typical marketing spend of  an enterprise software company. 
Thomasz Tomguz, a venture capitalist at Redpoint, has an excellent 
analysis of  sales and marketing spend of  34 public SaaS companies. 
In their first three years, these public SaaS companies spend between 80 
to 120 percent of  their revenue in sales and marketing!  
MYTH II — IT’S FAST
Reality  –  You  can  get  started  quickly  without  a  large  upfront  
investment, but getting good takes a long time. SaaS marketing is a 
game of continued refinement and measurement. As you will read 
in The Roadmap to SaaS Marketing Maturity section, each development 
phase can take several quarters.
DISPELLING SAAS 
MARKETING MYTHS

4  THE SAAS MARKETING HANDBOOK / TIM MATTHEWS
MYTH III — AUTOMATION MAKES IT EASY
Reality – Yes, there are amazing tools that are very affordable, and 
sometimes free. But everyone else is using those tools, too. You still 
need to get the basics right: a good product, a good offer, a solid 
understanding of  your buyer and their needs, and good execution. 
This is hard work. Also, all of  the A/B testing and experimenting is, in 
my opinion, more work than marketing teams have ever done before. 
Think of  it this way: for every deliverable marketing teams used to 
produce,  they  now  have  to  produce  at  least  twice  the  amount—an  
A  and  B—and  perhaps  an  ever-evolving  version.  I  would  argue  
that automation only raises expectations. (The Goosing Conversion and 
Fighting Churn section sheds more light on this.)
MYTH IV — SAAS MEANS FREEMIUM  
Reality  –  SaaS  is  a  delivery  model.  Freemium  is  an  acquisition  
model.  As  we  will  cover  later  in  The  Acquisition  Model,  freemium  is  
only  good  for  certain  products.  Many  complex  products,  such  as  
SaaS  accounting  packages,  require  a  more  conventional  enterprise  
software sales approach.

THE LANGUAGE OF CONVERSION
Name – As the generic nature of  the term suggests, this is just a name 
on  a  list  or  in  a  database.  At  this  point,  marketing  has  performed  
little, if any, qualification—except perhaps that this person matches 
the desired demographic or buyer profile.
Visitor – A visitor is a unique individual viewing a website. You can 
track a visitor using a cookie (if  the user hasn’t disabled cookies), but 
you  don’t  have  any  way  to  contact  the  person  and  may  not  know  
their name. 
Lead – At this stage, a prospect has responded to a marketing offer. 
He  or  she  has  expressed  some  level  of  interest  in  your  product  or  
service.  You  have  captured  their  email  address,  and  maybe  their  
company name and phone number.
Marketing-qualified  lead  (MQL)  –  An  MQL  is  a  lead  that  
marketing has qualified to some level and is ready to turn over to 
sales. The qualification process varies from company to company, 
but typically comprises a combination of profile (demographic, role) 
and activity (video watched, eBook downloaded). For example, you 
SAAS MARKETING LINGO
 Learning the Language of Conversion & Revenue
Figure 1: Stages of the conversion funnel
Note that MQL, SAL, and SQL are more common in B2B SaaS sales and marketing organizations. 
Self-service B2B and B2C SaaS may simply use the terms qualified lead and opportunity.  

6  THE SAAS MARKETING HANDBOOK / TIM MATTHEWS
may  decide  an  MQL  is  a  director-level  person  in  the  information  
technology  department  of  a  company  having  over  a  thousand  
employees,  who  has  viewed  an  online  product  demo.  Activity  can  
also include an inbound phone call, chat, or contact request, which 
are usually the hottest leads.
Sales-accepted lead (SAL) – At the SAL stage, sales acknowledges 
that an MQL meets the agreed-upon criteria and agrees to work it. 
SALs demark the handoff from marketing to sales. Sales can reject 
leads that are incomplete or that they’re already working. Just as the 
criteria being met are important to sales, an agreement to follow up 
within  a  prescribed  timeframe  is  important  to  marketing  so  that  a  
qualified lead doesn’t go cold.
Sales-qualified  lead  (SQL)  –  A  SQL  involves  a  decision  by  
sales, after additional qualification via discussions with the potential 
buyer, that a sales opportunity, having both a timeframe and budget, 
exists. Leads at this point are commonly referred to as opportunities. 
Upgrades,  upsells,  and  cross-sells  to  existing  customers  are  also  
called  opportunities.  These  may  not  come  all  the  way  through  the  
conversion funnel (Figure 1), depending on whether the opportunity 
was  created  via  a  marketing  promotion  to  existing  customers,for  
example, or through a conversation with a customer success rep or 
salesperson.
Customer  –  Once  a  deal  is  closed,  the  lead  has  become  closed  
business,  better  known  as  a  customer.  Existing  customers  can,  of  
course, become leads again for the purchase of  additional products 
or  services.  In  a  SaaS  business,  retaining  customers  is  critically  
important  because  monthy  or  annual  subscription  fees  are  such  a  
large part of  overall revenue. 
Lost  Lead,  or  Lost  Business  –  You  can’t  win  them  all.  I  
recommend tracking lost leads. Not only can you do win/loss analysis, 
but oftentimes lost leads can be put back into a nurturing queue—if  
the reason for the loss indicates they may be a qualified lead again 
in the future. For example, you may add a feature that the prospect 
was initially looking for and now let them know it’s available. If  they 
didn’t end up purchasing a competing product, or are dissatisfied 
with the competitor’s product, you might convert them. 
A lot of  marketers overlook lost leads. They are a detour from the 
linear funnel we all prefer, but sometimes you can end up with truly 
enormous  lists  of  past  lost  opportunities  that  are  actually  good  
quality lists that canconvert when the timing is better.

7  THE SAAS MARKETING HANDBOOK / TIM MATTHEWS
Cost Per Lead (CPL) – CPL is how much a lead costs to acquire. 
Many  companies  also  measure  cost  per  MQL,  or  CPMQL,  since  
what you really want to know is what it costs to generate a lead that is 
ready to turn over to sales. Note the difference between this and CAC 
(next),  which  measures  total  sales  and  marketing  costs—including  
salaries. CPL helps you evaluate individual campaigns or programs, 
while CAC helps you in discussing the company’s overall financials 
with the CEO and board of  directors.
Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) – This is the total sales and 
marketing expense required to acquire a customer. Said another way, 
it’s the total amount spent to move a visitor to a customer.

8  THE SAAS MARKETING HANDBOOK / TIM MATTHEWS
THE LANGUAGE OF REVENUE
Annual Contract Value (ACV)  –  This  is  the  annual  value  of  a  
customer contract.
Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) – This is the annual revenue 
that is expected to renew (recur) for a customer or set of  customers. 
ARR  is  the  total  contracted  revenue  of  all  customers,  minus  the  
percentage  that  won’t  renew—the  churn.  Note  the  difference 
between this and ACV, which doesn’t include churn. ACV is useful 
when discussing an individual account or when building your funnel 
for  new  business.  ARR  is  useful  when  discussing  the  state  of  a  
company’s overall business.
Churn  Rate  –  This  is  often  referred  to  simply  as  churn—that  
percentage of  customers who don’t renew. As discussed later, the goal 
is to keep this percentage as low as possible. A unit churn anywhere 
under  ten  percent  is  very  good  for  any  SaaS  business.*  For  some  
markets or products, the reality is that churn is simply higher. Figure 
2 shows the exponential decay of customers causing three different 
churn rates. 
After  24  months,  a  15  percent  churn  leaves  only  two  customers,  
while a five percent churn leaves 29. Churn can also be measured in 
dollars—termed “dollar churn.” And “negative churn” means that 
your company is expanding sales in existing accounts faster than it’s 
losing  revenue  from  those  who  don’t  renew.  Negative  churn  is  the  
ultimate goal.
* According to the “2014 Pacific Crest SaaS Survey,” the median unit churn for SaaS companies is eight percent. I think this survey paints a rosier picture than that of 
reality, as do some prominent VCs—like David Skok. It really depends on your business, but a unit churn of  under 15 percent is pretty good, while under ten percent is 
very good. 
Figure 2: Exponential decay of a customer base with 15, 10 
and 5 percent monthly unit churn — the depressing flipside 
of exponential growth...

9  THE SAAS MARKETING HANDBOOK / TIM MATTHEWS
Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) – This is how much a customer 
is worth over their “lifetime.” The length of  their lifetime depends 
on  your  business.  To  calculate  your  customer  lifetime,  divide  1  by  
your churn rate—a simple formula for expressing exponential decay. 
If  your annual churn rate is 20%, then your customer lifetime is 1 ÷ 
0.20, or five years. 
CLV  is  ARR  or  MRR  multiplied  by  your  customer  lifetime.  
Continuing with the prior example, CLV is ARR × 5. Understanding 
CLV is vital if  your CAC for a customer is higher than the ARR, since 
you’ll typically need more than one year to make up the difference 
and make the customer relationship a profitable one. 
Monthly  Recurring  Revenue  (MRR) –  This  is  the  monthly  
revenue  that  is  expected  to  recur,  (renew)  for  a  customer,  or  set  of  
customers.  It  can  be  calculated  as  ARR  ÷  12.  MRR  is  the  total  
contracted  revenue  less  the  percentage  that  will  not  renew—the  
churn.  Whether  you  measure  MRR  or  ARR  depends  upon  your  
business. If  you focus on annual contracts, then ARR is the way to 
go. If  you only bill monthly and have a high churn rate, MRR is a 
more conservative approach. 
Total  Contract  Value  (TCV) –  This  is  the  total  contracted  
revenue.  If  the  contract  is  for  one  year,  TCV  equals  ACV.  If  your  
customer  signed  a  two-year  contract,  perhaps  in  exchange  for  a  
favorable discount, TCV is correspondingly more.

THE ROADMAP TO SAAS 
MARKETING MATURITY
How to Set Expectations and Structure Growth
SAAS NIRVANA IS A TEMPTING, ALLURING PLACE. Stories 
abound on TechCrunch, Forbes, and other business press about the 
fortunes of  those who make it. Multiples for SaaS IPOs tend to be 
among the highest in the tech industry. There is palpable pressure, 
therefore,  for  a  SaaS  marketer  to  get  there  as  fast  as  possible.  But  
pushing against this headlong rush to El Dorado is another force—a 
discipline required to get it right before growth (the ramp) kicks in. 
You can burn a lot of  money if  you don’t get it right.
It’s  important  to  understand  the  stages  of  SaaS  sales  maturity  and  
communicate them to everyone in your organization. Knowing what 
stage you are in helps focus the team on the important goals, and to 
defer those that are not advantageous. 
On  the  following  page  is  my  SaaS  Marketing  Maturity  Model,  
developed  while  I’ve  held  three  SaaS  head  of  marketing  positions.  
The idea is to demark which stage your company and product are in, 
and therefore what is required of  marketing. It can feel like a chicken 
and egg problem, and there can be a lot of finger pointing. Is it the 
marketing or the market? Do you need to change the product or get 
more people to try it? Why can’t sales close more deals?

11  THE SAAS MARKETING HANDBOOK / TIM MATTHEWS
THE SAAS MARKETING MATURITY MODEL
Figure 3: The five stages of the SaaS Marketing Maturity Model, shown with focus, exit criteria, and timeframe by stage.
Exit Criteria 
Focus 
Stage 
Timeframe 
In order to achieve better team alignment, I recommend using these five stages. Agree among your team what [mark|goal|measurement|target] 
you are trying to solve for, and agree when you are ready to move from one stage to another. In general, marketing will need to provide content, 
some degree of public awareness, and some demand generation in all five stages, but your level of investment and tactical focus will vary. For 
example, demand generation in the initial Product/Market Fit stage may simply comprise setting appointments for your CEO and head of  
product to discuss possible directions with prospective customers.

12  THE SAAS MARKETING HANDBOOK / TIM MATTHEWS
PRODUCT/MARKET  FIT  –  Finding  buyers  who  want  your  
product is the goal of any business. SaaS is no different, except the 
online delivery  model affords  faster product changes.  During  this 
growth phase, the entire company needs to make whatever changes 
are required to make your product indispensable to an identified set 
of  buyers.  Marketing  should  focus  on  market  and  buyer  research,  
customer interviews, and competitive analysis during this stage. 
Exit  Criteria: A company can exit this phase when a significant 
percentage  of  customers  finds  the  product  indispensable  and 
marketing can identify the profile of an ideal customer.*
Timeframe: 6  –  18  months.  Some  companies  find  a  product/
market fit faster than others. Many need to significantly change the 
product—referred to as a “pivot”—at least once. Forbes ran a great 
article  about  business  pivots,  including  Twitter’s  transformation  
from  podcast  finder  to  microblogging  service,  and  PayPal’s  move 
from  beaming  payments  from  PDAs  (personal  digital  assistants,  or  
handheld computers) to helping eBay users pay sellers over the Web. 
Also,  the  more  complex  the  product,  the  longer  engineering  will  
need to built it (or rebuild it after a pivot).
EXPERIMENTING  FOR  GROWTH  –  Once  you  have  product  
market fit, determine the best way to reach your ideal customers. 
Marketing  should  focus  on  crystalizing  the  value  proposition,  as  
gleaned from discussions with existing customers. Close interaction 
with the sales team is really important—interview them, and also sit 
in on sales calls to learn what really resonates with customers. The 
team should also begin marketing via a few different channels, such 
as  Google  AdWords  and  sponsored  webinars,  and  do  some  rough  
A/B testing experiments to see what works best. The goal is to supply 
enough leads to feed the sales team.
Exit  Criteria:  A  company  can  exit  this  phase  when  it  has  a  few  
marketing channels and marketing pieces that demonstrate superior 
performance in closing deals. 
Timeframe: 3 – 12 months.
* Sean Ellis, a well known SaaS marketer, uses less stringent criteria, requiring 
40% of  customers to be “very disappointed” if  denied your product.

13  THE SAAS MARKETING HANDBOOK / TIM MATTHEWS
OPTIMIZING FOR GROWTH – Building on your successes, it’s 
now  time  to  optimize  conversion  rates  at  all  possible  points.  Invest  
more money in channels that are generating the highest conversion 
rates. Become even more aggressive with A/B testing: conduct more 
tests, make the experiments finer-grained, and delve into a continuous 
improvement  cycle.  Evaluate  each  channel  in  the  context  of  your  
business  economics;  some  may  convert  well  but  cost  more.  Make  
sure you can afford each channel by comparing it with your CLV. 
Eliminate  any  channels  that  are  ROI  negative  over  the  customer  
lifetime,  and  shift  investment  into  those  that  are  ROI  positive  over  
the shortest timeframe. Your goal 
is  to  move  beyond  just  supplying  enough  leads,  maturing  so  as  to  
know which channels produce the best leads.
Exit  Criteria:  Organizations  can  exit  this  stage  when  they  know  
their top conversion channels and marketing assets, and know that 
money invested in these will produce more demand and profitable 
customers.
Timeframe: 6 – 12 months.
PREDICTING  GROWTH  –  With  known  top  channels  and  
conversion rates, you can predict future revenue based on marketing 
activity. Testing and optimization can continue, 
but  a  marketing  chief  should  invest  in  people  and  tools  having  a  
focus on metrics and reporting. 
Marketing  may  begin  to  scrutinize  churn  here,  putting  in  place  
programs to reduce it as much as possible. By this stage of  maturity, 
your ARR has become a big enough number that high (or growing) 
churn is a problem. To reduce it, marketing might invest more in 
a marketing function to improve customer satisfaction, or work with 
the  product  team  to  develop  features  that  increase  your  product’s  
stickiness. Achieving negative dollar churn through aggressive upsell 
and cross-sell might even be possible. By this stage, marketing should 
have matured enough to measure leads by channel and by cohort.
Exit  Criteria:  Organizations  can  exit  this  phase  when  they  have  
two or three quarters of  accurate revenue prediction by marketing 
and churn has settled at an acceptable level.
Timeframe: 6 – 9 months.

14  THE SAAS MARKETING HANDBOOK / TIM MATTHEWS
DRIVING  GROWTH  –  With  a  tuned  and  predictable  demand-
generation machine, the marketing team can be a growth driver. ARR 
should be well understood and churn should be stabilized. Investing 
more  in  marketing  to  make  existing  customers  more  valuable  –  by  
upselling additional features or modules – might be a final tweak.
These  timeframes  are  general;  they’re  based  on  discussions  with  
several  SaaS  CEOs  and  CMOs.  Heads  of  marketing  should  gain  
consensus regarding which growth stage the company is in, as well 
as those activities on which marketing is focused. Maturation takes 
time.  Executive  teams  may  grow  restless  and  want  to  move  on,  
but  until  you  have  invested  time  in  the  market  and  have  data  that  
supports your experiments, forecasts and predictions, you just won’t 
know if  you were right. Marketing may need to stand tall, insisting 
on discipline from other teams that either want to skip stages or are 
expecting  magic  to  happen.  If  you  join  a  company  years  after  its  
founding, either as the first CMO or a replacement, you may even 
need to walk the company back a stage or two if  they got ahead of  
themselves.

15  THE SAAS MARKETING HANDBOOK / TIM MATTHEWS
Online  customer  acquisition  is  a  hot  topic  in  SaaS  circles.  Some  
companies can execute “no-touch” models at scale, such as Google 
AdWords.  “Low-touch”  models—getting  prospective  customers  
to  use  your  software  before  talking  to  a  sales  person—are  more  
common. Here, customers can try out a product on their own terms 
and schedule, while salespeople can work more efficiently by talking 
only to those customers who are ready to buy. Your product, however, 
may dictate a “high-touch” model, where sales and technical staff 
diligently  guide  a  customer  through  the  acquisition  process.  The  
following are four defined models for acquiring customers.
FREEMIUM
This  is  a  portmanteau  of  the  words  free  and  premium,  i.e.,  from  
free  to  premium.  Here,  customers  are  provided  a  useful  piece  of  
free software, with the option to purchase a premium version having 
additional features. Some SaaS companies build in a viral aspect to 
their  software,  so  that  even  though  freemium  version  users  aren’t  
paying, they add value as “advertisers.” Dropbox is a good example 
(and  a  service  I  used  in  the  editing  phase  of  this  ebook).  Dropbox  
Basic edition users share files with others and expose them to the file 
sharing service.
FREE TRIAL
Lets users sample software for some period of  time—usually a few 
weeks to a month—and then decide if  they want to buy it. Unlike 
freemium, users do not have software access after its trial period ends.
THE ACQUISITION 
MODEL
How to Choose the One That’s Right for 
Your Product

16  THE SAAS MARKETING HANDBOOK / TIM MATTHEWS
BLENDED
A free trial of your premium software version is offered for a limited 
time.  If  a  user  opts  not  to  purchase  after  the  trial  period  expires,  
they’re reverted to the free version having fewer features and possible 
other limitations. The idea is to hook customers on premium version 
features, using the free version as a no risk come-on.
DEMO
Not all SaaS vendors want to offer trials, even if they’re possible. 
For  example,  offering  a  trial  for  complex  products  requiring  user 
training—such  as  accounting  or  ERP  software—can  sometimes  
backfire  –  by  confusing  or  frustrating  users  –  and  thereby  hurt 
conversion. The high-touch sales model may be dictated by such a 
product, so a demo performed by a trained SE or salesperson may 
be required. Some companies offer assessments where they run their 
software for the client, then show the prospect their before and after 
results.

17  THE SAAS MARKETING HANDBOOK / TIM MATTHEWS
YOUR PRICING MODEL IS CRITICAL TO YOUR SUCCESS. 
Find  a  price  that  is  acceptable  to  your  target  customers  and  can  
sustain  your  business.  Pricing  a  SaaS  product  is  a  complex  topic  
that  is  beyond  the  scope  of  this  eBook,  but  here  are  a  few  basic  
considerations to get you started. (A few SaaS pricing references are 
listed at the end of  this eBook.)
PRICING UNIT
What are you selling and how is it measured? Is it per user, per server, 
per mega- or gigabyte, or something else? 
PROFITABILITY
 How much money do you need to earn to support your business? 
Understand  your  total  costs  (not  just  CAC),  make  conservative  
assumptions on customer lifetime and churn rate, and then model your 
business at different price points. Your tolerance for profitability—
and that of  your investors—should be taken into account. 
COMPETITIVE COMPS
 You may not be the first to market, so your hand may be forced by 
your competitor’s pricing strategy. Take a look around and see what 
others  are  doing.  Your  strategy  will  dictate  if  you  want  to  be  the  
low-cost  provider,  or  set  premium  pricing  based  on  your  product’s  
capabilities.
BUYER BEHAVIOR
How  are  your  buyers  used  to  purchasing  a  product  like  yours?  If  
they’re used to paying per user and your model is per gigabyte, that 
might introduce confusion—and thus friction—into your sale. Now, 
if  you are trying to disrupt a market, that’s another story. You may 
introduce a radical model that fundamentally changes the game.

BUNDLING
Most SaaS vendors have different bundles, or sets, of features that 
are  presented  as  editions,  or  plans.  A  common  set  is  Free,  Basic,  
Pro,  and  Enterprise.  As  previously  described,  your  editions  could  
be part of  a freemium strategy. Or, as research into human buying 
behavior has shown, having choice both removes buyer anxiety and 
pushes people to your middle to upper-middle plans. You may have 
a longer-term plan of  upgrading customers to higher editions over 
time as their needs grow.
FIT WITH ACQUISITION MODEL
It could be your buyer can only charge so much on a credit card. If  
you’re  using  a  no-touch  acquisition  model,  then  you  need  to  take  
that  into  consideration.  The  most  common  solution  to  this  sales  
roadblock is to offer multiple plans, as previously mentioned, that 
accommodate  a  no-touch  buyer  price  point.  Shown  at  the  right  in  
Figure 4 are the four plans we used for the Incapsula product line. 
Free drove awareness and grabbed tire kickers, but did little to actually 
drive  revenue.  Pro  was  a  nominal  part  of  our  MRR.  Business  was  
popular with small and midsize companies, and was a good source 
of upsell opportunities. The $299 price point was low enough for 
most to put on their credit card. Enterprise was our largest revenue 
generator. We had something for everyone.

19  THE SAAS MARKETING HANDBOOK / TIM MATTHEWS
The  next  step  is  to  design  a  sales  team.  This  likely  involves  a  
conversation  with  your  CEO  and  vice  president  of  sales.  The  
structure  of  the  team  should  follow  from  your  acquisition  model  
(below). Here are a few questions to ask yourself  to help determine 
which model could work for you.
• Is your product entirely self-service? Can a customer sign up, 
purchase with a credit card, and use the product successfully? 
If  so, do you need sales reps at all?
• What  is  your  product’s  ARR  and  anticipated  CLV?  Can  
a sales rep close enough deals to make it profitable? If the 
answer is no, then you either need to raise the price or make 
your product self-service.
• Is your customer used to buying from a sales rep, perhaps for 
cultural  reasons  or  regional  business  custom?  Can  sales  be  
done over the phone, or are there technical or cultural reasons 
why sales must be made face to face?
THE SALES MODEL
How to Staff a Team that Supports Your Acquisition Model
“Business leaders, sales 
executives, and investors are 
all looking to turn their brilliant 
ideas into the next $100 million 
revenue business. Often, the 
biggest challenge they face is 
the task of scaling sales.”
– Mark Roberge, SVP Sales, Hubspot

20  THE SAAS MARKETING HANDBOOK / TIM MATTHEWS
• Are  a  lot  of  decision  makers  involved  in  the  sale?  Is  an  
experienced  account  representative  needed  to  help  manage  
the buying cycle?
• Are  you  using  the  demo  acquisition  model,  where  an  
experienced sales engineer is required to set up the demo?
 
Armed with answers to the above questions, you should be able to 
determine which sales acquisition model works best. 
• Self-service – The sale can be completed without assistance 
from  another  human,  via  your  website  or  through  an  online  
store. Sometimes called a “touchless” sale.
•  Inbound  –  Prospective  customers  can  research  and  sign  up  
for your product via the Web, but need to speak to an inside 
sales person to complete the sale. 
•  Outbound  –  Inside  sales  representatives  (ISRs)  or  sales  
development  representatives  (SDRs)  make  outbound  calls  
to  likely  prospects.  Outside  account  representatives  call  on  
territorial accounts to gain interest.
•  Blended – Some combination of  the prior three models. For 
example, a low-priced version might be touchless, inside reps 
handle inbound demand for a more complex or fully-featured 
version,  while  outside  sales  reps  call  on  strategic  accounts  
in  their  territories.  A  blended  model  is  usually  a  sign  of  an  
organization’s  maturity,  where  it  has  grown,  segmented  its  
customer base, and has the capacity to execute three disparate 
models.

21  THE SAAS MARKETING HANDBOOK / TIM MATTHEWS
Sales Roles 
Your sales organization may include some or all of  the roles below. 
In addition to the acquisition model, the maturity of  your company 
is an important factor. 
• Lead  Development  Representative  (LDR)  –  An  
individual responsible for qualifying inbound leads and passing 
them  to  sales,  typically  taking  leads  and  moving  to  MQLs.  
LDRs work for the marketing department. Depending on the 
company, an LDR can pass to SDRs or directly to a sales rep.
• Sales  Development  Representative  (SDR)  –  Working  
for  the  sales  department,  SDRs  receive  MQLs  and  further  
qualify  them.  Typically  when  an  MQL  has  been  qualified 
to  a  certain  stage,  or  the  potential  customer  has  agreed  to  a  
sales  call,  the  MQL  is  passed  to  a  sales  representative.  SDR  
goals are based on qualified leads or appointments set, not a 
product sales quota.
• Inside Sales Representative (ISR) – A sales representative 
working on the phone. In some companies, ISRs handle lower-
end customers or smaller deal sizes, so have lower quotas. For 
certain products, ISRs can work all of  your deals.
 In a no-touch model, you do not need account managers, and may or may not need ISRs.

22  THE SAAS MARKETING HANDBOOK / TIM MATTHEWS
• Account Manager – A salesperson who meets customers at 
the latter’s offices. Account executives are paid more, generally 
have higher quotas, and work deals over a certain amount—
typically $25K – $50K and above.
• Customer  Success  Manager  (CSM)  –  Some  SaaS  
companies have created this new position, which is part sales 
engineer, part product consultant, and part customer service. 
A  CSM  works  inside,  much  like  a  customer  support  rep,  
but  may  use  a  tool  to  monitor  the  progress  of  customers  to  
proactively  drive  successful  onboarding,  rollout,  and  product  
adoption. Strictly speaking, a CSM is not in a sales role, but 
can be critical to driving renewals and upsell revenue.

23  THE SAAS MARKETING HANDBOOK / TIM MATTHEWS
BUILDING YOUR CONVERSION FUNNEL
TO EFFECTIVELY DRIVE DEMAND FOR A BUSINESS, your 
marketing organization must determine a target number of  leads it 
needs  in  each  stage.  The  easiest  way  to  calculate  these  numbers  is  
to  start  with  your  revenue  target,  and  then  work  backward  up  the  
funnel  (see  Figure  5).  Using  known  or  estimated  conversion  rates,  
along  with  the  average  sale  size,  you  can  reverse-calculate  how  
many SALs and SQLs you need to produce the required number of  
customers. Similarly, you can calculate how many MQLs you need 
to generate the required number of  SQLs, and how many inquiries 
you need to produce your target number of  MQLs.
There  is  an  additional  important  consideration.  Make  certain  
you  understand  how  much  new  revenue  your  marketing  team  is  
responsible for generating (in particular, how much new ARR, since 
renewals  won’t  require  new  leads).  In  many  SaaS  organizations,  
marketing is responsible for 100 percent of  the demand for new ARR. 
In  organizations  having  sales  development  reps  doing  outbound  
calling, or where territory reps prospect in their patch, it may only 
be 50 to 75 percent. 
Figure 5: How to reverse calculate leads needed 
to generate $5 million in sales

24  THE SAAS MARKETING HANDBOOK / TIM MATTHEWS
After  you  have  established  your  revenue  target,  and  the  percent  
of qualified leads marketing needs to generate, you can start your 
calculations.  If  you  don’t  have  historical  data  to  rely  on,  you  can  
obtain conversion rates from a number of marketing research firms. 
These include Sirius Decisions and Forrester Research, in addition to 
the many excellent SaaS blogs, such as SaaStr and For Entrepreneurs.
Here  is  an  example.  Let’s  say  you  have  a  net  new  ARR  target  of  
$5  million.  Your  company  is  relatively  young,  with  new  ISRs  and  
little carried over pipeline, so the assumption is that marketing is to 
generate 100 percent of  the leads for new ARR. 
To keep the math simple, your product will sell for the non-negotiable 
ACV  of  $25,000.  Inverting  the  funnel  for  emphasis,  Figure  5  
illustrates this reverse-calculation process.
STEP 1: Start with a target of  $5 million. 
STEP 2: Divide this total by the average ARR ($25,000) to determine 
the  number  of  customers  you  need.  $5,000,000  ÷  $25,000  =  200  
closed opportunities. 
STEP 3: Calculate the total number of  opportunities, or SQLs, you 
need to generate 200 closed opportunities. Your VP of  sales believes 
his reps can close one out of  every three potential deals. Thus, 200 
× 3 = 600 SQLs. 
STEP  4:  Calculate  the  number  of  MQLs  needed  to  provide  sales  
with 600 SQLs. Having worked with this team for awhile, you know 
that  sales  accepts  all  of  our  MQLs,  so  the  number  of  SALs  and  
MQLs are the same. You also know that sales qualifies approximately 
three in every four MQLs (75%). 600 ÷ 0.75 = 800. You need 800 
MQLs to generate 600 SQLs. 
STEP  5:  Now  determine  how  many  initial  inquiries  you  need  to  
produce 800 MQLs. You know that about 50% of  them convert to 
MQLs. 800 ÷ 0.50 = 1,600 inquiries required. 
When your process gets more mature, you should measure the ratio 
of  inquiry to MQL by channel and create a weighted average. For 
example, display ads may convert less frequently than pay-per-click 
(PPC) ads, so calculate a weighted average for overall conversion that 
takes this into account. (Hopefully, in this case it goes without saying 
that you should shift your spend to PPC as well).
STEP 6: Our final step—and potentially the most discouraging—is 
to factor in your direct mail response rate and that of  the free trial on 
your website. Let’s say this rate is 2%. 1600 ÷ 0.02 = 80,000. Thus, 
to  obtain  1,600  inquiries  you  need  a  combined  80,000  prospect  
names sourced from both your database and website visitors. 

25  THE SAAS MARKETING HANDBOOK / TIM MATTHEWS
Be  a  realist,  not  a  Pollyanna  when  creating  your  funnel  model.  
Your  sales  price  should  be  your  average  sales  price—reflecting 
typical discounts—not your suggested list price. When in doubt, be 
conservative  by  picking  lower  conversion  rates.  Keep  in  mind  that  
conversion rates are usually much higher for existing customers, so 
treat  them  well  and  market  new  products  to  them  whenever  you  
can.  If  your  CFO  wants  to  know  why  marketing  needs  so  much  
money, show him or her the conversion funnel, and explain the costs 
associated  with  buying  or  acquiring  80,000  database  names  and  
website visitors.
Also, it’s worth noting that the marketing team may have a role to 
play  in  renewals.  Unlike  on-premise  software  sales,  where  the  bulk  
of  the revenue is made upfront and then the customer is essentially 
trapped  into  paying  annual  support  and  maintenance  fees,  SaaS  
renewals are a more significant piece of the revenue. A customer, 
not having made such a large upfront investment, has more freedom 
to leave, and the financial impact is greater on the SaaS vendor. So 
while the inverted conversion funnel is a useful way to visualize how 
to calculate net new ARR, your team will need some programs for 
renewals.

26  THE SAAS MARKETING HANDBOOK / TIM MATTHEWS
WHILE THE SAAS BUSINESS MODEL IS QUITE DIFFERENT 
from  perpetual  software  license  sales,  the  marketing  tactics  are  
not  entirely  unique.  SaaS  companies  still  go  to  trade  shows,  have  
customer  newsletters,  and  engage  in  direct  marketing.  The  real  
difference is not in the tactics, but rather the emphasis on those tactics 
in  the  marketing  mix.  Here  are  a  few  guiding  principles  regarding  
how the buying cycle is different, and the resulting impact on your 
marketing mix.
Marketing Carries More of  the Load – The new IT buyer may 
be  50  –  75  percent  through  the  buying  cycle  before  they  are  turned  
over to sales, according to Forrester and other sources. The new term 
for this is inbound marketing. In some cases, your marketing department 
will be responsible to create 100 percent of demand flow and customer 
signups that ultimately turn into sales. So no more taking back seat to 
the sales department—marketing is in the driver’s seat.
HOW SAAS AFFECTS THE MARKETING MIX
The new IT buyer may be  
50 to 75 percent through  
the buying cycle before  
ever talking to a sales rep.
Customer Self-Education – With more of  each sale happening 
before a rep ever speaks to a prospect, or with no sales rep involved at 
all, more emphasis is placed on collateral to help customers educate 
themselves during the sales process. Contrast this with the amount 
of  time  and  energy  spent  on  creating  sales  tools  and  conducting  
training.  With  the  emphasis  on  customer  self-education,  more  of  
the  marketing  mix  must  skew  toward  content  marketing,  with  the  
aim of  educating the customer on a topic relevant to the product, in 
addition to just the company’s product. HubSpot, a SaaS marketing 
Not All of Your Tactics Will Change, But the Emphasis Will Shift

Saas companies have an 8% 
median annual unit churn
– 2014 Pacific Crest SaaS Survey
Online  versus  Channel  Distribution  –  It  used  to  be  that  
software  companies  needed  value-added  distributors  and  their  
resellers to scale. Today the Internet provides the scale. Partners are 
sought for their industry expertise or integration capabilities, more 
so than for distribution reach.
Note  that  buyers  of  perpetually-licensed  (on-premise)  software  are  
becoming  increasingly  involved  in  SaaS  product  purchases.  Thus  
the emphasis seen in the SaaS marketing mix will no doubt have an 
influence on conventional software and hardware marketing, further 
blurring the lines.
automation  company,  spends  a  lot  of  time  and  money  creating  
educational  content  on  marketing  best  practices.  Blogs  and  online  
tools will increase in importance.
Transactional  Sales  –  Many  SaaS  products  generally  have  a  
lower price point, or at least a lower-priced entry point. Vendors of  
this product type need to think about large  numbers of  transactions, 
as  opposed  to  enterprise  software  companies  focused  on  larger  
individual deals. Generally, SaaS companies are looking to sign up 
users for a trial or demo, and then move them toward a sale, rather 
than simply setting up a meeting for one of  their salesperson. Much 
more  emphasis  will  be  on  online  marketing  and  email  nurturing,  
coupled  with  a  greater  focus  on  optimizing  your  website  for  sales  
conversion. 
Customer  Retention  –  In  the  conventional  software  model,  a  
customer pays more upfront to acquire a perpetual license, then pays 
a much smaller annual support and maintenance fee (usually 20 – 25 
percent) after that. With SaaS, the customer renews at 100 percent 
of  ACV every year, and your business model may depend on making 
back  your  CAC  in  years  two  or  three.  SaaS  marketing  teams  are  
much  more  focused  on  renewals,  therefore.  As  an  integral  part  of  
the marketing mix, ongoing customer communication becomes that 
much more important.

MEASURING RESULTS
SAAS IS A NUMBERS GAME. ANY SAAS MARKETER WORTH HIS SALT will know his metrics cold. Share them with others in your 
company. My ideal is to have such confidence in my numbers that I have a live dashboard on a monitor outside of my office or in the marketing 
area. As of  the writing of  this eBook, I am one to two quarters away from that goal.
Below are some of  the metrics I think a SaaS CMO should share, weekly and monthly (and daily once you get your monitor mounted)
FIGURE 6: Weekly tracking of MQL target attainment

29  THE SAAS MARKETING HANDBOOK / TIM MATTHEWS
WEEKLY 
MQL  attainment –  I  adapted  the  attainment  graph  shown  in  
Figure 6 from a sales ops colleague who reported revenue this way. 
I like it because it tracks progress weekly, the same interval used by 
sales  in  their  reporting.  The  green  line  is  simply  a  straight  zero  to  
100  percent  plot  against  the  thirteen  weeks  in  a  quarter.  The  solid  
purple line shows the percent of  MQLs attained. The dotted trend 
line reflects an estimate (93%) of where we will end up (Microsoft 
Excel can automatically calculate the trend line). All you need to do 
is  calculate  the  number  of  MQLs  you’ll  need  for  the  quarter  and  
divide  by  the  number  of  weeks  (13  in  this  case)  to  determine  your  
weekly target. You then plot your MQLs each week, expressing them 
as a percentage versus expected. You can see in the sample plot that 
marketing was below average until week seven. 
Another reason I like this format: It readily illustrates when you need 
to  adjust  your  marketing  mix  to  dial  up  the  number  of  MQLs  if  
you’re falling behind, or dial them down if  you’re generating more 
leads than your sales team can handle. If  your company doesn’t have 
confidence in the MQL to SQL/opportunity conversion rates, you 
might also track SQL attainment on a weekly basis.
Free  trial  signups  –  If  free  trials  are  part  of  your  acquisition  
model, then track these on a weekly basis as well.
MONTHLY
Conversion rates for Lead | MQL | SQL | Close – Show the

CPL and CPMQL by channel or campaign – Shows how much 
leads and MQLs cost per channel or campaign. Don’t get seduced 
by low cost leads that are low velocity or low conversion rates. You 
get what you pay for.
Deal  velocity  by  channel  or  campaign  –  Shows  how  many  
days it takes to close by channel or campaign—the “velocity.” Deals 
that close faster might cost more, but you may find yourself needing 
to acquire more of  them, depending on the health of  your funnel.
ROI  by  channel  –  Calculated  as  (revenue  -  cost)  ÷  cost,  and  
expressed  as  a  percentage.  This  the  moment  of  truth.  You  may  
discover negative ROI, requiring you to figure out how to reduce cost, 
up the conversion, or drop the channel or campaign. You may find a 
program or campaign is ROI negative in year one (using ARR), but 
positive over the customer lifetime, calculated as (CLV – cost) ÷ cost.
Website  visitors –  If  website  visitors  are  a  key  piece  of  your  
marketing, which they probably are, then track them on a monthly 
basis.  Understand  which  pages  visitors  are  viewing  the  most  and  
spend time optimizing them.

30  THE SAAS MARKETING HANDBOOK / TIM MATTHEWS
Note that if  your focus is on MRR, or your SaaS business is mature—the Driving stage of  the SaaS Marketing Maturity Model—then some of  
your monthly metrics might be reported on a weekly basis.
Putting this all together, Table 1 below allows you to show all of  your metrics in a way that’s easily understandable and with enough detail for 
a good discussion.

BECOMING A METRICS NINJA
WITH THE BASIC MARKETING METRICS WELL IN HAND, 
a good SaaS marketer has more to learn before achieving elite status.
COHORTS AND COHORT ANALYSIS
A cohort is a group of  people having a statistical factor in common. In 
social sciences, the factor can be age or gender. In SaaS marketing, 
it’s  typically  the  month  a  customer  signed  up,  e.g.,  the  January 
cohort.  Cohort  analysis  is  a  study  of  a  cohort’s  metrics  and  their  
likely contributing factors. 
What was the CAC for the January cohort? Why was it lower? Did 
you optimize the landing page or reduce your ad spend to acquire 
them? How about the churn? Did December’s product improvements 
have an effect on the January cohort? And so on. 
Cohort  analysis  is  especially  important  in  SaaS  because  customers  
pay  monthly,  the  marketing  team  is  changing  acquisition  tactics  
monthly,  or  because  the  product  is  changing  monthly.  Or  all  of  
these. Measuring quarterly or annually may mask important trends 
that  you  should  continually  know  about  (so  as  to  be  able  to  react  
more quickly).
“Cohort analyses are the 
only way to get a good 
understanding of retention 
and customer lifetimes.”
– Christoph Janz, Point Nine Capital,  
“9 Worst Practices in SaaS Metrics”
However, note that delineating cohorts by month can be meaningless 
if  you  haven’t  made  any  changes  in  your  product  or  process  that  
would cause people (e.g., site visitors) to behave differently. Likewise, 
some other factor that indicates higher revenue potential, 
or  the  likelihood  of  cancellation,  may  be  more  powerful  than  the  
month  they  signed  up.  You  can,  for  example,  group  customers  by  
those who used a certain feature or responded to a promotional offer.
THE MAGIC NUMBER, A.K.A., CAC RATIO
The magic number is a metric that can be used to determine the health 

32  THE SAAS MARKETING HANDBOOK / TIM MATTHEWS
of  your  SaaS  business.  It’s  credited  to  Josh  James,  then  CEO  of 
Omniture  (subsequently  acquired  by  Adobe).  It’s  also  commonly  
referred to as the CAC ratio, although there is a subtle difference 
in that the magic number is a specific measure of CAC with certain 
assumptions  on  payback  period  and  future  upsell.*  Every  SaaS  
marketer should know his magic number. It’s a measure of  how long 
it  takes  to  recover  the  money  you  spend  to  acquire  a  customer.  A  
shorter payback period is better. 
Here is how it works: Divide your new recurring revenue by the sales 
and  marketing  costs  required  to  generate  it.  Your  CFO  should  be  
able  to  tell  you  the  annual  sales  and  marketing  cost—the  CAC—
which includes your marketing programs plus all sales and marketing 
salaries.
Assuming leads from Q3 close in Q4, the calculation is:
((Q4  recurring  revenue  –  Q3  recurring  revenue)  ×  4)  ÷  sales  and  
marketing cost 
You  subtract  Q3  recurring  revenue  from  that  of  Q4,  so  as  not  to  
count  renewals.  Plugging  in  some  simple  numbers,  let’s  say  Q4  
recurring  revenue  is  $2,000,  while  that  of  Q3  is  $1,000.  The  new  
ARR you acquired in Q4 is $1,000 × 4 = $4,000. You spent $4,000 
in marketing programs, plus the sales and marketing staff salaries to 
generate it. So your calculation is: 
$4,000 ÷ $4,000 = 1. This means you make your money back in one 
year. Not bad, and if  the CLV is three years, or $12,000, it’s a pretty 
profitable customer.
Figure 7: CAC ratios for different ARRs
* N.B.: There are many variants of the CAC ratio and the magic number. The first big difference is whether you base it on revenue or gross margin. I prefer revenue, 
because it’s easier to get these numbers. Also, as Dave Kellogg points out, the CAC ratio measures the efficiency of acquiring customers—how many dollars to earn a 
dollar—while gross margins have more to do with the overall efficiency of the business, including hardware, networks, engineers, and many other factors. Some people 
flip the ratio, putting cost in the numerator (top) position, and revenue/margin on the bottom. Just be clear how you calculate CAC ratio with your audience. Obviously 
you are talking about two very different numbers if you put costs in the numerator versus denominator! If you are raising venture capital, find out how the firm you are 
pitching calculates it and use their method.

33  THE SAAS MARKETING HANDBOOK / TIM MATTHEWS
It could also be that you spend more to bring in the customer than 
you make in the first year. If CAC was $8,000, then $4,000 ÷ $8,000 
= 0.5. Now it takes two years to make our money back. Not bad, but 
not as good.
If  you  were  very  efficient,  perhaps  by  having  lower  marketing 
program costs or more touchless signups, and your CAC was $3,000, 
then  the  calculation  would  be  $4,000  ÷  $3,000  =  1.33.  Here,  you  
make our money back in nine months ($1,000 per quarter, multiplied 
by three quarters). This is a very good magic number. In the words 
of  Bessemer  Venture  Partners,  one  of  the  early  proponents  of  the  
magic  number,  “Anything  above  one  (1)  means  you  should  invest  
more  money  immediately  and  step  on  the  gas  (and  please  call  
Bessemer immediately because we want to fund you!).”
Figure 7 shows these three magic numbers in chart form. You can 
easily see the payback period for the $4,000 investment in acquiring 
a customer. Keep in mind that most companies would expect a two-
to-three year CLV, assuming a churn of  less than ten percent, so all 
of these customers will be profitable.
CLV:CAC RATIO
This tells you the average ROI per customer. It is similar to the magic 
number  or  CAC  ratio,  but  looks  at  revenue  over  the  full  customer  
lifetime, not just one year. A ratio of  three or above is good.

When you get really good, you’ll be able to track not just your weekly 
progress, but forecast the number of  MQLs and opportunities that 
marketing  will  generate.  The  linear  trend  line,  shown  previously  
in  Figure  6,  is  one  way  of  forecasting.  You  can  also  dig  into  your  
past performance and current marketing plans and make your own 
forecast, as shown in Table 2 (following page). 

34  THE SAAS MARKETING HANDBOOK / TIM MATTHEWS
Table 2:  Marketing forecast
This  table  shows  forecasted  opportunities  for  the  current  month  
‘Cur.’ (fourth column from right) and the subsequent three months 
(columns  labeled  +1,  +2,  and  +3).  It  also  shows  the  previous  four  
months for comparison purposes (columns labeled -1, -2, -3, and -4). 
The forecast tracks the following:
•  Commit  –  (top  row)  the  number  of  opportunities  you  feel  
certain you can achieve.
•  Target  –  (second  row)  a  higher  total  than  the  commit  that  
you will drive the marketing team toward. The target is also 
a hedge: if  the marketing team misses the target, they should 
still hit the commit.
•  Forecast – Based on current information, your best estimate 
about  the  number  of  opportunities  in  the  current  and  next  
three quarters. The forecast will float either higher or lower 
than the target and the commit. A CMO would, for example, 
shift resources if  the forecast in any of  the next three quarters 
slips below the commit.
• Actual – The actual results allow for performance evaluation. 
For  example,  in  the  previous  month  (-1)  this  team  generated  
86 opportunities against a commit of  82. Actuals aren’t shown 
for the folloing three months, as they aren’t yet known.

GOOSING CONVERSION 
AND FIGHTING CHURN
NURTURING
Nurturing is  the  process  of  moving  a  lead  closer  to  a  sale  through  
continued  marketing.  It’s  not  unique  to  SaaS  marketing,  but  is  
especially  important.  Prospects  in  your  database  who  aren’t  yet  
ready to buy need to be nurtured until they are ready to buy. Email 
marketing  is  the  most  common  form  of  nurtuing.  The  trick  is  to  
understand  what  type  of  content  is  of  interest  to  your  prospects,  
and  how  many  times  (number  of  touches)  each  needs  to  see  your  
content  before  they’re  ready  to  buy.  It  might  take  anywhere  from  
five or ten touches before they’re ready. Make sure the content is 
valuable  and  you’re  not  just  spamming  them,  else  your  campaign  
could backfire. But do some form of nurturing —it’s much more 
expensive  to  acquire  brand  new  prospects  than  to  work  with  ones  
already in your database.

page at Incapsula. Changing ‘Contact Us’ to ‘Get Quote’ 
resulted in an over 200% increase in conversions.
THE POWER OF TWO WORDS

36  THE SAAS MARKETING HANDBOOK / TIM MATTHEWS
A/B TESTING 
Optimization is critical in SaaS marketing. The most basic technique 
is  known  as  A/B  testing.  In  the  case  of  email,  marketers  send  out  
two  variants  simultaneously  (an  A  and  a  B).  The  variants  might  
each  contain  a  different  subject  line,  offer,  body  copy,  or  layout. 
Alternatively, you might send the same copy to two different lists—
perhaps different age groups or cities—using a tracking mechanism 
to ascertain which demographic generates more responses. You then 
adopt the “winner” of  the A/B test as the preferred email piece. The 
idea is to only change one thing in each test, send it out to a limited 
subset of  your list, pick the winner, and then continue tweaking. 
The new B is sometimes called the challenger, while A is the champion. A/B 
testing can be used for web pages, landing pages, registration or sign up 
forms, pay-per-click ads—almost anything marketing creates. While any 
increase in conversion is good, new A/B experiments, to which they’re 
referred, should be prioritized by the biggest potential gain.
CUSTOMER SUCCESS
Customer  success  is  a  companywide  approach  to  ensuring  new  
customers are onboarded successfully. The most important goal is to 
ensure prospects are able to productively use your software during the 
trial period, and that recently-signed customers are able to roll it out 
successfully within their organizations. Some SaaS companies have 
created a new position—a customer success manager—that is part 
system engineer, part product consultant, and part customer service. 
This person’s job includes ensuring that customers are making good 
progress  on  adoption,  are  engaged,  and,  most  importantly,  are  
realizing expected business results from your solution.
A  whole  new  crop  of  tools  has  emerged  that  lets  SaaS  vendors  
monitor a customer’s progress during trial, onboarding, and ongoing 
use. They then alert the customer success team about issues such as 
simply lack of  use, need for training on new or advanced features, 
drop  in  engagement  from  key  executives,  or  gaps  in  the  customer  
realizing benefits from your software. Customer success managers 
may  also  play  a  part  in  the  renewal  process,  depending  on  the  
company.

CASE STUDY
Sysomos  is  a  social  media  analytics  and  monitoring  solution  that  
provides context to the hundreds of  millions of  online conversations 
happening every day. The company had seen a steady rate of  churn 
over  several  years.  It  needed  to  understand  why  customers  were  
leaving so it could put programs in place to mitigate the problem.
At  the  end  of  2013,  its  client  experience  chief  was  tasked  with  
implementing a new customer success strategy. 
It  would  allow  Sysomos  to  reduce  customer  churn,  grow  revenue  
from within its existing customer base, and differentiate itself from 
its competitors. Part of this effort was finding a customer success tool 
that  would  help  the  company  monitor  customer  engagement  from  
product usage, measure results customers were experiencing with its 
product, and compute a predictive health rating for every customer 
that  could  be  shared  companywide.  Sysemos  chose  a  customer  
success platform from Totango.
After deploying a customer success tool from Totango, Sysomos was 
able to improve customer experience and reduce churn. The health 
scoring  system—combining  usage  data,  net  promoter  score,  and  
customer  engagement  with  its  communications—helped  alert  the  
customer success team as to which customers needed attention and 
why. By using Totango and the health scoring system, Sysomos was 
able to reduce its overall churn rate by 25 percent in just one year.

AVOIDING COMMON PITFALLS
PITFALL #1
 “[Person’s name] a [board member | personal friend | fellow CEO | next-door 
neighbor] told me they are getting a [ridiculously high number] conversion 
rate for [a dollar amount ranging from zero to implausibly cheap]. Why can’t 
we do that?” 
Make  sure  you’re  comparing  apples  to  apples  and  you  get  
documented  proof  of  said  conversion  rate.  People  commonly  
confuse the following:
• All of the different conversion rates
• Conversions versus click-throughs
• Cost per name versus cost per qualified lead
• Any number of  other items
Also, conversion rates have a shelf  life. Technology and user habits 
are constantly changing, so rates from more than a year or two ago 
should be scrutinized before they’re trusted.
PITFALL #2
No money. Going back to Dispelling SaaS Marketing Myths, SaaS 
marketing costs money. More often than not, the ways you generate 
conversions  early—by  tweaking  the  signup,  SEO,  and  blogging—
involves  people,  your  most  expensive  line  item.  Once  you  are  past  
that  stage,  you  need  more  people  and  money  to  grow.  Be  wary  
of a SaaS startup that doesn’t have significant money to invest in 
marketing.
I  HAVE FALLEN INTO ALMOST EVERY ONE OF THESE PITS—some of  them more than once. I’ve learned the hard way that you need 
to clearly set expectations, as well as under-promise and over-deliver, to be a successful SaaS marketer.

39  THE SAAS MARKETING HANDBOOK / TIM MATTHEWS
PITFALL #3
No  or  bad  data.  You’ll  need  software  and  people  to  gather  and  
analyze data. Make sure you have staff, tools, and access to stats from 
your website, product, and CRM. And you’re never done collecting, 
cleaning,  or  analyzing  data,  so  make  it  part  of  your  marketing  
routine, not an annual exercise. 
Corollary: Collect your own data and do your own analysis lest others 
do it for you (trust me, the analysis of  others will never be better...)
PITFALL #4
Using marketing metrics with business people. Lesson: Use business 
metrics. 
A nice thing about SaaS is that common understanding among its 
players of  the importance of  metrics—the straightforward revenue 
and  churn  metrics  you  can  use  to  align  sales,  marketing,  and  
development. 
Conversations about cohorts and multi-touch nurturing should wait 
until the entire executive team is on the same page regarding ARR/
MRR, churn, and your magic number. I’ve found that conversations 
about MQLs, multi-touch attribution, and other marketing metrics 
are less effective and require significant education of the executive 
team. 
PITFALL #5
Doing  traditional  marketing  for  a  SaaS  business.  Trade  shows.  
Printed materials. Field marketing. 
Change it up, lest you be considered a dinosaur.

Claim–Evidence–Reasoning Primer 
Category: 
Proprietary Insight / Framework Fragment 
 (with External / Third-Party Evidence) 
Purpose: 
This primer outlines how SaaS startups and small teams can use guerrilla marketing — 
unconventional, low-cost, creativity-driven tactics — to generate awareness, trials, and 
retention. 
 Each section applies the Claim–Evidence–Reasoning (CER) method to ensure tactics are 
strategic, testable, and evidence-grounded. 
 
1. What Guerrilla Marketing Means for SaaS 
Claim: 
 Guerrilla marketing enables early-stage SaaS products to punch above their budget by trading 
dollars for creativity, timing, and authenticity. 
Evidence: 
 Historical examples include Dropbox’s 2008 referral loop (no paid ads, exponential user 
growth), Notion’s viral template community, and Figma’s design challenges — all leveraging 
community and earned attention. 
Reasoning: 
 SaaS markets are saturated. Attention is expensive. Guerrilla marketing reframes the equation: 
small teams can dominate narrow attention niches (Discords, GitHub, subreddits, indie 
newsletters) where authenticity, surprise, and cultural timing outperform paid CPMs. 
 
When Guerrilla Works Best 
● Your ICP is concentrated (e.g., developers, content creators, growth marketers). 
 

● You can deliver a “wow” moment in under 2 minutes. 
 
● You can ship or pivot campaign assets quickly (feature flags, build-measure loops). 
 
● Your product has shareable or demonstrable outputs. 
 
Guardrails 
● Stay ethical — no deception, privacy violations, or disruption of others’ platforms. 
 
● Align every stunt or experiment with your brand voice and tone. 
 
● Pre-clear visuals, trademarks, and disclaimers before publishing. 
 
 
2. The Four-Loop Guerrilla Engine 
(Category: Proprietary Insight / Framework Fragment) 
This framework turns creativity into repeatable process. 
Loop A — Spike 
Create a moment of surprise or spectacle that cuts through noise. 
● Launch a free micro-tool, dashboard, or data leak that showcases your product’s 
capability. 
 
● Example: Ahrefs’ “Free Backlink Checker” drove millions of organic visits to their paid 
tool. 
 
Claim: 
 A public utility or insight tool can drive sustained brand impressions and backlinks 10× cheaper 
than paid acquisition. 
Evidence: 
 Ahrefs, HubSpot’s free CRM, and Airtable templates demonstrate the “micro-utility magnet” 
effect: free value earns durable SEO and social traction. 
Reasoning: 
 Reciprocity bias + utility bias → users trust brands that provide free functional value upfront. 

 
Loop B — Capture 
Convert that spike of attention into owned audiences and trial users. 
● Use micro-CTAs: waitlists, gated templates, or Discord invites. 
 
● Add frictionless signup — no credit card, one-click OAuth. 
 
Claim: 
 Without capture, spikes decay. Converting 15–30% of viral traffic into an owned channel 
multiplies ROI. 
Evidence: 
 Research from PLG companies shows sign-up friction is the #1 leak in viral funnels; single-click 
signup improves conversion by 22–35%. 
Reasoning: 
 Eyeballs are cheap; relationships compound. Guerrilla success = awareness converted into an 
addressable audience. 
 
Loop C — Wow 
Deliver the core value within 120 seconds. 
● Preload sample data, templates, or demo flows. 
 
● Showcase transformation (before/after visuals, live results). 
 
Claim: 
 Shortening time-to-value from 10 minutes to 2 minutes increases activation by 40%. 
Evidence: 
 Amplitude and Mixpanel onboarding studies confirm dramatic gains when users hit their “aha 
moment” early. 
Reasoning: 
 Guerrilla tactics bring new users fast; only rapid perceived value keeps them. 
 

Loop D — Echo 
Encourage users to amplify your campaign through sharing and remixing. 
● Add badges, referral prompts, remixable assets, or open-source snippets. 
 
● Reward community-driven improvements. 
 
Claim: 
 A single motivated community can multiply exposure 10–50× through earned posts and 
remixes. 
Evidence: 
 Notion’s public templates and Linear’s open design kit became viral artifacts in creator 
communities. 
Reasoning: 
 Empower users to “show off” their success; social proof outperforms brand voice. 
 
3. Tactics Library — CER Mini-Briefs for SaaS 
Each brief shows how to structure a guerrilla campaign using the Claim–Evidence–Reasoning 
pattern. 
 
Tactic 1: Engineering-as-Marketing Microtools 
Claim: 
 A free micro-tool addressing a frequent pain point drives 10–20% of new trials organically. 
 Evidence: 
 Tools like Mailchimp’s “Subject Line Helper” and Clearbit’s “Logo Finder” generated millions of 
backlinks and social mentions. 
 Reasoning: 
 Utility tools trigger sharing, boost SEO, and build reciprocity without paid spend. 
 
Tactic 2: Opinionated Benchmarks 
Claim: 
 Publishing a live benchmark (e.g., “Average API latency by region”) positions your product as a 

data authority. 
 Evidence: 
 Cloudflare Radar and GitLab’s DevSecOps Reports yield consistent media pickup and 
backlinks. 
 Reasoning: 
 Data creates authority. Authority attracts buyers seeking proof, not promises. 
 
Tactic 3: Template Packs & Instant-Wow Kits 
Claim: 
 Curated, ready-to-run templates shorten time-to-value and increase activation 15–30%. 
 Evidence: 
 Notion’s template gallery became its #1 acquisition lever. 
 Reasoning: 
 Reducing setup friction lets users experience outcomes before cognitive load sets in. 
 
Tactic 4: Community Challenges & Bounties 
Claim: 
 Targeted build challenges in niche communities yield bursts of user-generated content and 
backlinks. 
 Evidence: 
 Devpost hackathons and Product Hunt “Build with X” campaigns show repeatable engagement 
surges. 
 Reasoning: 
 Gamified contribution creates credibility; user builds validate product relevance. 
 
Tactic 5: Ethical Newsjacking & Memetic Formats 
Claim: 
 Fast, tasteful riffs on breaking news drive short-term engagement spikes. 
 Evidence: 
 Timely posts in the same format (threads, reels, carousels) outperform generic promos by 
3–5×. 
 Reasoning: 
 Algorithms reward recency and relevance. Pair it with a live demo link to convert virality into 
sign-ups. 
 

4. Designing a Guerrilla Campaign Using CER 
Every campaign should pass a CER checklist: 
Stage Question Example 
Claim What measurable effect do 
you expect? 
“We’ll double trial signups from developer Twitter 
within 2 weeks.” 
Evidence What proof supports this 
claim? 
“We’ve seen similar tactics generate 15% CTR and 
10% conversion.” 
Reasonin
g 
Why will it work here, 
now? 
“Developers crave simple utilities; novelty in timing 
aligns with product update.” 
Pro tip: Treat every guerrilla idea like a hypothesis. Test, measure, refine, and publish your 
results. 
 
5. Execution Blueprint (One-Pager) 
Use this structure for each new tactic. 
● Audience Slice: Define who you’re targeting (role, community, pain). 
 
● Value Spike: What’s the surprising or delightful utility? 
 
● Creative Concept: Headline, hook, and visual tone. 
 
● Mechanism: Why it works — psychological trigger or market insight. 
 
● Setup: Assets, engineering resources, compliance checks. 
 
● CTA & Capture: Trials, waitlists, referrals, or templates. 
 
● Launch Plan: Channels, partners, seeding steps, and timing. 
 
● Success Metrics: Funnel — impressions → clicks → trials → activations. 
 
● Attribution: UTMs, codes, surveys, post-signup data. 
 
● Post-Mortem: Lessons to scale, repeat, or kill. 
 

 
6. Measuring Impact and Iterating 
Claim: 
 Guerrilla tactics are sustainable when treated as an iterative growth system, not one-off stunts. 
Evidence: 
 Companies like Ahrefs, Linear, and Notion run quarterly “creative sprints” to test, measure, and 
evolve campaigns. 
Reasoning: 
 Treat guerrilla like R&D: rapid prototyping + evidence-based learning. Winning stunts become 
evergreen assets. 
Key Metrics 
● Reach: Impressions, mentions, backlinks 
 
● Conversion: Clicks → sign-ups → activations 
 
● Retention: % of users returning after first session 
 
● Echo: Organic reposts, user content, community adaptations 
 
 
7. External / Third-Party Evidence Base 
(Category: External / Third-Party) 
Anchor every claim to credible data sources: 
● Research: 
 
○ Berger, J. Contagious: Why Things Catch On — frameworks for virality. 
 
○ Jonah Sachs, Winning the Story Wars — narrative triggers for shareability. 
 
○ Nielsen Norman Group — user friction & behavior data. 
 
● Industry Reports: 
 

○ HubSpot’s State of Marketing, 2024 
 
○ Gartner SaaS Adoption Curves 
 
○ Clearbit and Ahrefs growth benchmarks 
 
● Communities: 
 
○ Indie Hackers, Product Hunt, Hacker News, dev.to, and LinkedIn creator data. 
 
● Open Data Sources: 
 
○ Google Trends, Reddit API, Stack Overflow insights. 
 
Each external evidence source strengthens your reasoning chain, transforming “cool idea” into 
“credible hypothesis.” 
 
8. Building Your Internal CER Library 
Create a simple Google Sheet or Notion database to document every guerrilla test. 
Columns: 
● Date / Campaign 
 
● Claim (falsifiable) 
 
● Evidence (data or benchmarks) 
 
● Reasoning (mechanism & context) 
 
● Outcome (metrics) 
 
● Next Action (iterate / scale / kill) 
 
After 6–8 cycles, you’ll have proprietary growth IP — your internal Guerrilla Playbook. 
 
9. Common Pitfalls and Recovery Patterns 

Pitfall Impact Remedy 
Over-engineered 
campaign 
Slow launch, missed 
trend 
Reduce scope to 1-week prototype 
No capture mechanism Traffic with no 
conversion 
Add micro-CTAs (email, waitlist, demo 
link) 
Off-brand humor or 
ethics 
PR backlash Establish brand tone + legal review 
Poor measurement Inconclusive results Define metrics pre-launch; use UTMs 
Ignoring reasoning Copying trends blindly Always explain why it works for your 
ICP 
 
10. Closing Insight 
Guerrilla marketing in SaaS isn’t chaos — it’s structured creativity grounded in 
Claim–Evidence–Reasoning discipline. 
 You can afford to be bold because you measure, reason, and adapt faster than legacy 
competitors. 
Your next step: 
 Run one small, falsifiable guerrilla experiment within 7 days. 
 Write its claim, collect evidence, test the reasoning. 
 Then do it again — until creativity compounds into reputation. 
 
Final Reminder 
Every guerrilla idea becomes valuable IP only when paired with its Claim, its 
Evidence, and its Reasoning. 
 Make your marketing tactics teach you something — every single time.

ABSTRACT
The minimum viable product (MVP) is a fundamental concept
of the Lean Start-up approach as it enables a company to
quickly start the learning process by integrating feedback
from early adopters. Although the MVP concept has evolved
over the years, its application is most often reported in a start-
up context, even though established companies struggle to
develop MVPs. This study reports on the experience and les-
sons learned at Texuna, an established company, where the
software product innovation team created a process map for
developingMVPs.Thisisthefirst study that allows the original
MVP approach to be extended and applied to established
organisations.

1. Introduction
The Lean Start-up approach has been promoted as a way to nurture product
innovation in established companies (Märijärvi et al.,2016). The Lean Start-up
approach has received some attention from established companies including 3M,
Telefonica, and General Electric. However, adapting an approach intended for
a start-up context so that it can work effectively in established companies with
established operating policies and procedures is challenging (Kirsner,2016). For
example, the development of an MVP, a fundamental concept of the Lean Start-up
approach, which enables companies to quickly start the learning process by inte-
grating feedback from early adopters (Blank,2007) has been identified as a key
challenge for established companies.
Reis (Ries,2011) advocates that a company should commence building as quickly
as possible with an MVP, which is a‘version of the product that enables a full turn of
the Build-Measure-Learn loop with the minimum amount of effort and least amount
of development time’(p. 77). When a company makes changes to the MVP, based on
what they have learned about customers it is known as pivoting (Bosch, Olsson,
Björk, & Ljungblad,2013). It is through this iterative process of learning and pivoting
that validation of a‘product-marketfit’(PMF) is achieved. A PMF requires three

criteria to be satisfied, (i) the customer is willing to pay for the product, (ii) there is
an economically viable way to acquire customers, and (iii) the market is large enough
for the business (Cooper & Vlaskovits,2010). Brown (Brown,2009) advocates that
a product must therefore fulfil and balance three overlapping criteria (i) desirability
(what people want), (ii) feasibility (what isfunctionally possible), and (iii) viability
(what is likely to become a sustainable business model). A business model describes
the viability of a company in terms of how it fulfilsitspurpose,itsgoalsandits
ongoing plans for achieving them.
From a practice perspective, the overlapping criteria require a multidisciplinary
approach that involves a diverse team of people with different skill-sets in order to
provide a holistic solution (Zupan & Nabergoj,2012). This study presents a process map
for developing MVPs that achieve these three criteria (desirability, feasibility, and
viability).
RELATED WORK ON THE LEAN START-UP APPROACH IN ESTABLISHED COMPANIES
The Lean Start-up approach has been proposed as a new
approach to innovation in situations where there is
extreme uncertainty regarding who the customer is
and what the customer’s needs are. A start-up is
defined (1) as‘a human institution designed to create
a new product or service under extreme uncertainty.
That means entrepreneurs are everywhere and the
Lean Start-up approach can work in any size company,
even a very large company, in any sector or industry.’
A study of 170 business executives by (2) reports that
82% of them are using some elements of the Lean
Start-up approach in their company and that
developing a MVP has been a specific challenge.
The Lean Start-up approach has been shown to be quite
effective (3) and is rapidly becoming the primary
model for start-up innovation, overcoming challenges
typically faced by start-ups, such as time and cost
constraints, limited to a very small number or even
a single entrepreneur, and facing competition from
established organisations with diverse and multi
skilled workforces, all of whom have access to
a massive and diverse set of resources. However,
despite this popular opinion, many established
companies often face similar constraints.
The MVP is a fundamental concept of the Lean
Start-up approach as it enables companies to
quickly start the learningprocessbyintegrating
feedback from early adopters. A review of
literature by (4) identified twenty-two definitions
of MVP in studies between 2001 and 2015.
Whether or not the Lean Start-up approach
might support software product innovation in
established companies and how best to approach
it remains under studied (5,6).
Previous studies that focused on the application of
the Lean Start-up approach in established
companies created frameworks that support the
setting up of‘internal’start-ups. While such
studies and associated frameworks provide much
needed guidance on setting up internal lean
start-ups, they do not support practitioners to
develop MVPs.
While this study builds on earlier work by (7), it
differs because the authors include the CEO of
Texuna and the former Director of Research and
Innovation (DRI) who provide reflections and
lessons learned from theirexperience. To the best
of our knowledge, it is thefirst study to empirically
investigate the development of MVPs, using the
Lean Start-up approach to developing MVPs in an
established software company.

2. Background to Texuna
Founded in London in 2000, Texuna has offices located in the UK, Ireland and Russia.
Texuna has a strong reputation for designing scalable and secure data platforms that
adhere to international standards (e.g. ISO 27,001 for Information Security, ISO9001
for Quality Management, and ISO2000 for IT service management). Its client base
includes both public and private sector clients from a range of industries and it
supports in excess of 70,000 end-users dispersed across a large geographical area.
In 2012 the company collaborated with University College Cork (Ireland) in establish-
ing an Edtech Research Centre (ERC) for the purpose of investigating opportunities
for future products and services using customer-centric design methods. The ERC was
co-located with the company’s Shared Services Centre. The CEO sought to explore
new approaches that would enable the company to be more effective in bringing
product ideas forward to successful product launches. The research team recom-
mended the Lean Start-up approach to support the development of MVPs as the
existing software development method (Scrum) was not supporting the team to
develop multiple MVPs concurrently.
In itsfirst year of operation, the ERC adopted a Lean Start-up approach to successfully
developfive MVPs. An example of one MVP was a student evaluation platform to
administer high stake formative and summative examinations to students.
The university researchers, including two authors of this paper, were given full access
to the ERC and were embedded in the day-to-day activities of the innovation team for
a period of six months. During this time the frameworks emerged in tandem with the
adaptation of the Lean Start-up approach within the ERC. For instance, the student
evaluation platform was released as an MVP to a number of pilot sites (e.g. a private
education entity, a local university, a training unit in a global pharmaceutical company).
In addition, focus groups were held students, lecturers, administration and management
staff, as well as those participating in the pilots. During the focus groups, participants
interacted with the MVP and were presented with a number of questions. After the focus
groups, the pilot sites continued to use the MVPs and they provided daily feedback.
Online usability testing of the MVP was also organised. The insights from these activities
informed the evolution of the framework and process map presented in this paper.
3. The frameworks explained
This section presents two frameworks that can assist established companies to develop
MVPs.Figure 1represents the three overlapping criteria (desirability, feasibility, viability)
for a product to be successful and the iterative process between MVP and PMF.
The‘desirability’space develops the necessary collaboration with the stakeholders by
asking‘What do people desire?’and ultimately‘How do people decide on new products?’
A company needs to start by determining what would deliver value to the stakeholders.
The‘viability’space clarifies the answer to the question‘What is a sustainable business
model?’The‘feasibility’space considers‘What is technically and organisationally feasible?’
The solutions that emerge at the end of this iterative process should be positioned at
the intersection of these three dimensions (desirability, feasibility, and viability). It is here
that sustainable innovation occurs as it is based on understanding and fulfilling the

needs of the customer, creating products that are technically feasible, and sufficient
value is generated for the company.
Building onFigure 1and the context of Texuna, an MVP process map (Figure 2)was
developed. The MVP process map advocates a process that commences with gaining insights
from current or potential customers; this is the primary motivation for creating a new product
and forms the basis for developing the initial MVP. If the level of desirability is insufficient, then
the company must decide to either pivot the problem (by moving to an alternative problem)
or to end the exploratory phase completely. In most instances though, the desirability phase
reveals various problems that were not envisaged by the design team during the ideation
phase. Adding new features to the product, removing features not desired, or modifying
features that were problematic for users subsequently refine the MVP. This results in a new
version of the MVP and a second iteration of the evaluation process is required. This iterative
evaluation process is repeated until the MVP moves closer to the PMF. Once the PMF is
achieved, then evaluation is complete and a product launch is planned.
4. Lessons learned from adopting the MVP concept
The natural inclination of the Texuna Edtech Research Centre (ERC) team (and especially
those from a technical background) was to focus on questions of feasibility. They
needed to be redirected to questions of desirability and viability. The Director of
Research and Innovation (DRI) realised that the most likely failure points in the MVPs
would be issues of‘desirability’and‘viability’. For this reason, three circles of equal size
representing desirability, feasibility and viability were added to the MVP-PMF conceptual

framework. In order to highlight the importance of developing the MVP to address the
specific need of customers, the‘Empathise Step’was added. This placed a clear focus on
taking the time to understand the needs of the customer and the context in which they
would engage with the product.
The‘Evaluate-Pilot Step’initially included the word‘test’(Pilot Test Step). However, it
was observed that the word‘test’gave the impression that the value of the MVP could be

objectively judged in absolute terms through traditional software testing, whereas the
opposite was found to be the situation. The concept of pilot sites became fundamental to
the approach and to building empathy. In some situations, an MVP that worked well did
not necessarily meet the needs of a pilot site. In addition, an MVP that worked well in one
pilot site did not necessarily work as well in another. The word‘evaluate’was found to
better reflect the activity required to judge the relative value of the MVP.
Another interesting lesson was the natural instinct among some members of the
innovation team to delay the release of the MVP to pilot sites. There was a strong culture
within Texuna for delivering quality software and team members were often heard to judge
themselves by the quality of their outputs. Employees were therefore keen to perfect those
outputs before handing them over to pilot sites. In addition, MVPs were deemed by team
members to have been a‘failure’when they were less well-received by pilot sites even
though many insightful lessons may have been learned from their release. The natural
instinct was, therefore, for the MVPs to be seen as outputs rather than a means for learning–
the focus thereby gradually creeping away from learning towards quality.
The early release of MVPs contributed, at times, to low morale within the team.
The teams felt they were releasing low-quality outputs that had not been fully
developed or fully tested. The DRI had to consistently challenge this mindset and
in some cases, he decided to release MVPs to pilot sites (even when he himself had
some concerns about their quality) as he wished‘to send out a message to his own
team of the need for early customer involvement’.
The addition of the‘Synchronise Step’was critical to the success of the MVP Process
Map at Texuna. The innovation team successfully developed and evaluatedfive MVPs
that provided large market opportunities for Texuna. However, a great deal of effort was
needed in order to build the core capabilities required within Texuna to leverage these
opportunities. For example, Texuna did not always have the sales and marketing
bandwidth or skillsets to actively market a number of these MVPs, which differed from
the traditional offerings of the company. The Synchronise Step was included to recog-
nise the need for changes in the parent organisation in order to take advantage of the
opportunities offered by the Lean Start-up approach. It could not be taken for granted
that an established company can benefit from the Lean Start-up approach without
internal changes (e.g. change in organisation culture, behaviours, systems, etc.).
It was noted that fatigue had set in within the innovation team whose members were often
working on daily release cycles in response to faster feedback from a growing number of pilot
sites. The fact the team was co-located with other company staffworking at a slower pace
created tension. Members of the innovation team felt they were being asked to shift from
a‘large team mentality’with its clearly defined functional roles to a more‘flexible mentality’
where they needed to‘roll up their sleeves’and take on different roles in order to get the job
done. This suited some people but not all. For example, a senior developer saw this as eroding
his‘market value’, which he felt, was based on producing high-quality code using leading
edge software tools. He wanted to be given clearly defined requirements rather than working
in an environment where the needs of the customers emerged in an agile participatory way.
Team members were encouraged to make fast and courageous decisions. The cultural
differences between the high-speed learning-based approach advocated by the Lean Start-
up approach openly clashed with the slower paced culture at Texuna. It was increasingly
apparent to the DRI that the former was not part of the dominant culture of the company
6D. DENNEHY ET AL.

and that the only way it would survive is with the continued support of the organisational
leadership. Some internal stakeholders, however, advocated that the team should slow
down and indeed others felt that it should be disbanded. As a compromise, the executive
leadership requested that the speed be reduced and that other areas of the company would
use some of the expertise within the team. For example, team members were increasingly
asked to support the sales team in selling current products.
Throughout the project, the researchers compiled a set of generic evaluation ques-
tions (seeTable 1) that were collected from the discourses that took place at the ERC
regarding the resulting MVPs. These questions being used to test the concepts of
desirability, feasibility, and viability of an MVP.
This set of evaluation questions supports both innovation teams and managers to balance
discussions when evaluating their MVPs asit ensures that innovation teams do not have
a‘rose tinted’view of their MVP, which may be technologically feasible but lack desirability
and/or viability. Analyses of the answers to these questions can include quantitative techni-
ques such as sentiment analysis and qualitative techniques such as thematic analysis.
5. Recommendations
We have observed how the MVP process map has strengthened the company’s mental
models of how to go about introducing new opportunities for learning from an MVP,
although the capability to do so is perhaps building up at a slower pace. It is fair to say
that some software product development team members have a greater appetite and

aptitude for the Lean Start-up approach. We expect that this Lean Start-up oriented
mindset will have a long-term effect as the frameworks have reshaped Texuna’s current
design practices and design philosophies.
The recommendations presented below are based on observations by the authors derived
fromthecasestudiedbutwhicharelikelytoberelevanttothemanagementteamsofother
established companies interested in implementing a Lean Start-up approach.
Shared understanding about the purpose of a MVP: The MVP concept presented challenges
for management and development teams as its purpose was misunderstood (e.g. MVP seen as
a product to be delivered as opposed to a means for learning). This led to team members
experiencing a sense of‘failure’when an MVP required pivots or a fear that colleagues or
management would consider their outputs to be of low quality. Management and develop-
ment teams need to be informed from theoutset about the purpose of the MVP.
Balancing feasibility with desirability and viability: Members of the innovation team
possessed strong technical skills, which enabled them to create software that showcased
their technical know-how. However, efforts had to be made on a continuous basis to
ensure that issues of desirability and viability were also being considered in the design
of the MVPs.
Achieving PMF requires organisation-wide support: The Edtech Research Centre pro-
ducedfive MVPs, but not all of them ended up being released to the market. As Texuna
did not have the sales and marketing capabilities to actively market these products,
opportunities were lost. These capabilities need to be developed within the company in
order to leverage emergent opportunities.
Changing organisational culture: The cultural differences between the high-speed
learning approach clashed with the slower paced culture of Texuna. The agility of the
innovation team and its ability to make prompt decisions challenged the status quo,
which created tensions. Changing the organisational culture requires continued support
of the organisational leadership and in certain instances a compromise may be required
to satisfy all stakeholders.
There is a strong rationale underpinning each component of the MVP-PMF con-
ceptual framework and the MVP process map. We would, therefore, strongly discou-
rage practitioners from adopting all components without reflection and tailoring.
Instead, companies should ensure that the Lean Start-up approach is considered
within its wider innovation management portfolio. Each component of the diagrams
presented in this paper may be more relevant and critical in certain product/software
design contexts than others. We encourage practitioners to reflect on each and to
adopt or tailor as necessary in order to determine whether the Lean Start-up itself is
suitable in that instance.

A True Story 
I’m  sitting  in  a  quiet  room  at  the  Millcroft  Inn,  a 
peaceful  little  place  hidden  behind  the  pine  trees 
about an hour out of Toronto. It’s just past noon, late 
July,  and  I’m  listening to  the  desperate  sounds  of a 
life-or-death struggle going on a few feet away. 
There’s a small fly burning out the last of its short 
life’s  energies  in  a  futile  attempt  to  fly  through the 
glass  of  a  windowpane.  The  whining  wings  tell  the 
poignant story of the fly’s strategy — try harder. 
But it’s not working, 
The  frenzied  effort  offers  no  hope  for  survival. 
Ironically,  the  struggle  is  a  part  of  the  trap.  It is 
impossible for the fly to try hard enough to succeed at 
breaking through the glass. 
Nevertheless,  this  little  insect  has  staked  its  life  on 
reaching  its  goal  through  raw  effort  and 
determination. 
This fly is doomed to die. It will die there on the 
windowsill. 
Across the room, ten steps away, the door is open. 
Ten  seconds  of  flying  time  and  this  small  creature 
could reach the outside world  it  seeks.  With  only  a 
fraction  of  the  effort  now  being  wasted,  it  could  be 
free  of  this  self-imposed  trap.  The  breakthrough 
possibility is there. It would be so easy. 

you
2  
Price Pritchett 
Why  doesn’t  the  fly  try  another  approach, 
something  dramatically  different?  How  did  it  get  so 
locked  in  on  the  idea that  this  particular route,  and 
determined effort, offers the most promise for success? 
What logic is there in continuing, until death, to seek 
a breakthrough with “more of the same”? 
No  doubt  this  approach  makes  sense  to  the  fly. 
Regrettably, it’s an idea that will kill. 
“Trying  harder”  isn’t  necessarily  the  solution  to 
achieving more. It may not offer any real promise for 
getting what you want out of life. Sometimes, in fact, 
it’s a big part of the problem. 
If you stake your hopes for a breakthrough on trying 
harder  than  ever,  you  may  kill  your  chances  for 
success.

Are you ready for this? 
Right  now,  in  this  moment,  you  are  capable  of 
exponential improvement in your performance. You can 
multiply  your  personal  effectiveness,  hit  new  highs, 
and shatter your old achievement records. The results 
you can have will be hard for you to imagine. 
You can become you

You don’t have to settle for things as they are now. 
That can change. Dramatically. If you’re ready, life is 
prepared to give you a breakthrough experience. You 
can jump to a higher orbit of achievement...live the 
dream...enjoy a completely different plane of success. 
Also, you don’t have to be content with improving 
things incrementally or gradually. Just as your level of 
performance can improve drastically, so can your rate 
of  accomplishment.  Furthermore,  the you

  formula 
requires far less effort than you’ve given in the past. 
You  haven’t  been  reaching  your  full  potential.  So 
far, you haven’t even come close. No matter how you 
wish to measure success, regardless of how you define 
achievement, you have barely scratched the surface of 
what you personally can accomplish. 
But  maybe  the  time  has  come  to  change  all  that. 
Maybe you’re ready to make a quantum leap.

Quantum Leaps 
Quantum leap is a term taken from the vocabulary of 
the  new  physics—quantum  physics—the  science 
behind  such  technological  breakthroughs  as  lasers, 
television,  computers,  space  communication,  and 
nuclear energy. Quantum physics is described as the 
most  powerful  science  ever  conceived  of  by  human 
beings. It requires a major rethinking of such concepts 
as time and space, and how the human consciousness 
operates. 
Quantum  physics  also  has  staggering  implications 
regarding you, your potential, and the power of the 
mind. To put it simply, as human beings we are going 
to have to reframe our ideas about the universe and 
how we fit into it. 
Fred Alan Wolf, in his award-winning book titled 
Taking the Quantum Leap, describes the term as... 
the explosive jump that a particle of matter undergoes in 
moving  from  one  place  to  another...in  a  figurative 
sense,  taking  the  quantum  leap  means  taking  a  risk, 
going off into an unchartered territory with no guide to 
follow. 
Physicists  studying  quantum  mechanics  note  that 
particles  make  these  “jumps” without  apparent  effort 
and without covering all the bases between the starting 
and ending points. 
What’s going on here? How does this happen? And 
is it possible for you as an individual to do something 
very similar in your personal performance?

Most  people  operate  with  a  mindset  that  assumes 
success comes one step at a time. The unspoken but 
popular notion  is  that  we  must move  systematically 
from  our  present  level  of  achievement  to  the  next. 
Then, the thinking goes, from that stage we can begin 
working  toward  graduating  to  still  the  next  higher 
level in the sequence. Gradual progress. 
This  is  an  unfortunate  misconception,  and  it’s 
clearly  reflected  in  the  way  we  function.  They  go 
about, day to day, striving to make incremental gains 
in their performance. That’s pretty routine. That’s the 
pathway of conventional growth. 
But your life simply does not always have to operate 
that way. 
Advancing at a measured pace—step by step from 
where  you  are  to  a  little  bit  better—ordinarily  feels 
easier,  more  natural,  and  even  safer.  But  in  certain 
areas of your life you can just as easily think in terms 
of skipping levels. You can move from your present 
level  of  achievement  to  one  that  is  several  stages 
higher—directly. 
You  make  the  quantum  leap.  You  become you

performance that puts you far beyond the next logical 
step.  It’s  a  formula  for  stunning  advances  in 
achievement and the realization of your dreams. The

2  
Price Pritchett 
concept  is  one  of  exponential  gains  rather  than 
incremental  progress.  You  might  compare  it  to 
multiplying instead of adding—it means a geometric 
progression in your effectiveness. 
That’s  exciting  as  well  as  provocative,  but  it  gets 
even  better.  Remember,  quantum  leaps  can  come 
without apparent effort. These are high velocity moves 
that  carry  you  to  dramatically  higher  performance 
levels without a time-consuming struggle. 
Quantum  leaps  seem  to  violate  common 
sense...utterly!  The  idea  of  “moving  to  a  higher 
orbit,” and skipping several rungs on the achievement 
ladder  in  the  process,  strikes  people  as  far-fetched, 
maybe even outrageous. 
After  the  fact,  quantum  leaps  maybe  viewed  as 
practical,  sensible,  even  obvious  moves,  but  they 
typically do not come to you as the obvious moves at 
the  moment.  Usually  it’s  in  retrospect  that  you 
perceive their hidden logic and elegance. Invariably, 
quantum  leaps  are  not  complex  or  intricate 
maneuvers. They tend to be simple, energy efficient, 
and time-saving.

Change your personal rules for 
success. 
Leveraging  up  your  personal  effectiveness  by  an 
order of magnitude—going from you to you
2
—is not a 
commonplace  idea.  You  should  not  be  surprised  to 
hear  that  unconventional  success  calls  for 
unconventional approaches. 
Quantum  leaps  require  paradoxical  behavior. 
Unusual  moves.  Actions  that  on  the  surface  often 
seem to contradict common sense. 
As human beings, though, we ordinarily go with the 
obvious. We fall into the habit of relying on behaviors 
that seem to have worked best for us over the years. 
When  we  take  an  approach  that  seems  to  be  very 
serviceable, and which enables us to perform well and 
succeed, we become attached to it. We don’t readily 
relinquish  that  habit  pattern.  In  fact,  there’s  a 
tendency  to  follow  our  favorite  approach  more  and 
more  often,  such  that  we  get  better  and  better  at 
handling things that particular way. 
This  adroitness  with  a  certain  approach  results  in 
our  over-dependence  on  the  strategies  and  tactics  it 
involves.  We  resist  new  maneuvers  because  they 
make us feel clumsy, awkward, and more at risk. 
But  if  you  want  to  accelerate  your  rate  of 
achievement  rapidly,  you  must  search  out  and 
vigorously  employ  new  behaviors.  New  attitudes. 
You must be willing to break out of your routines in 
order to make the quantum leap. 

you
2  
Price Pritchett 
The  things  that  worked  for  you  in  the  past  very 
likely could, sooner or later, lose their serviceability. 
Even if your customary approach still holds promise 
for maintaining your present level of performance and 
growth curve, it may not help if you want to hit far 
higher achievement levels. 
And if you continue to rely on those old routines, 
maybe  even  leaning  on  them  most  when  your 
performance flattens out or sags, you create a trap for 
yourself. 
There is a certain irony here. Your historically most 
dependable behaviors can become the major obstacles 
to future success. It’s possible for them to cripple your 
progress. They may stand as personal boundary lines 
that limit what you can accomplish with your life. 
There is, however another course of action. It is the 
way of the quantum leap. you
2
. 
The following chapters explain the peculiar strategy 
that is involved. 
 
 
If you want to accelerate 
your rate of achievement 
rapidly, you must search 
out and vigorously 
employ new behaviors. 

you
2  
Price Pritchett 
Quit trying harder. 
Quantum  leaps  cannot  be  achieved  through 
incremental steps or through “more of the same.” 
You’ve got to shift gears. You have to follow new 
patterns  of  thought  and  action.  The  rules  of  what 
works and what doesn’t always change when you are 
trying to make a move from normal performance to 
you
2
. 
Stop  and  think  about  it. Here’s  the  way  it  goes—
“more of the same” usually just gives you more of the 
same. 
Of course, if that’s mainly what you’re after, fine. 
Try a little harder and get a little bigger payoff. Try a 
lot harder and you can expect a lot better results. 
Right? 
Sooner  or  later  you’re  going  to  reach  the  point 
where you can’t try any harder. It may be that your 
spirit flags, or that your physical and mental resources 
are stretched to the limit. And often, well before you 
come to that set of circumstances, you reach the point 
of  diminishing  returns—trying  harder  and  harder 
starts  producing  less  and  less.  Sometimes,  in  fact, 
intensifying  your  efforts  produces  nothing  except 
bigger problems. 
As a case in point, go back to the story of the fly. 
That  little  insect  could  have  turned  away  from  the 
window  180  degrees  and  followed  the  path  of  least 
resistance as it flew to the open door. A quantum leap 
to  freedom.  Ten  seconds  of  effortless  flight  would 

you
2  
Price Pritchett 
have  produced  total  success,  while  hours  of 
frustration and panic spent beating its wings against 
the glass were destined to end fruitlessly in death on 
the dusty windowsill. 
Now this is not the argument against self-discipline 
or persistence. Those are true virtues. Over a lifetime 
they can make a powerful contribution to success and 
achievement. 
They are fundamental to the development of your 
talents.  It’s  extremely  important  to  apply  yourself 
diligently,  and  sometimes  “staying  power”  is  what 
delivers a big win. 
But  ordinarily  you  will  find  that  trying  harder 
produces only incremental gains, not quantum leaps. 
Also  keep  in  mind  that  trying  harder  (even  a  lot 
harder)  sometimes  offers  little  more  than  a  straight 
path  to  burnout.  Attempting  to  succeed  through 
“more  of  the  same,”  being  resolute  and  relying  on 
committed effort, can blind you to better pathways. 
If you want to make a quantum leap, quit thinking 
about trying harder. More effort isn’t the answer. 
 
 
 
“More of the same” 
usually just gives you 
more of the same.

Ignore conventional ways. 
Get ruthless about trying something different. 
Ordinarily we achieve conventional growth because 
we  think  along  conventional  lines.  We  experience 
reasonable  performance  gains  because  we  rely  on 
reasonable approaches. We find ways to make modest 
improvements in our level of success because we go 
looking for nothing more. 
Quantum  leaps  require  you  to  abandon  the  status 
quo.  Instead  of  once  again  trying  what  you  have 
always  done,  maybe  with  even  more  intensity  and 
determination, ignore the usual.

Look  for  a  paradoxical  move.  For  example,

Ricochet. If you’re pushing against the wall, open a 
door and walk through. If you’re pushing against the 
river, try going with the flow. Use finesse instead of 
effort. 
You must do something new! 
The tendency, when you stall out or begin to level 
off in  your  performance,  is  to  go  back  to  the  basics 
and “do what you do best.” But doing what you do 
best  can  be  the  worst  thing  you  could  do.  It  really 
doesn’t matter how well you can do something if it’s 
the wrong thing to do. 
“Faith in the familiar” sets the trap. And you spring 
it when you reinvest yourself in what logically seems 

you
2  
Price Pritchett 
like it would work because it usually worked in the 
past. 
To make a quantum leap, you’ve got to break out of 
the  rut  where  you’ve  been  running.  Second-guess 
your  routines.  Overcome  the  addiction  to  your  old 
methodologies. Set a new pattern. 
If the things you’re doing have quit working, stop 
doing them. Focus on what works. If you’ll just quit 
what you’ve been doing, instead of doggedly doing it 
harder,  you  at  least  create  an  opportunity—some 
“space”—to do something else. 
Quantum  leaps  come  when  you  seek  the  elegant 
solution.  So  look  for  an  approach  characterized  by 
simplicity, precision, efficiency, neatness. It won’t be 
as  complex  or  time  consuming  as  your  present 
struggle.  Overall,  it  will  be  less  demanding  of  your 
energies  and  emotions.  And  it  probably  will  not  be 
familiar to you.

Think beyond what common 
sense would allow. 
Most  of  us  can  be  found  flying  too  close  to  the 
ground. Too often we don’t give ourselves permission 
to soar. 
It’s  time  to  start  focusing  on  possibilities,  rather 
than on limits or obstacles. Making a quantum leap 
means moving outside your mental boundaries. If you 
will  rethink  how  you’re  thinking,  you  can  multiply 
your performance potential. You must let your desires 
guide you, instead of allowing yourself to be boxed in 
by perceived constraints. 
Seeking  the  quantum  leap  means  violating  the 
boundary  of  the  probable.  It  means  achieving  well 
beyond  the  obvious.  So  don’t  limit  your  desires  to 
what  you  think  you  “can  have”...start  going  after 
what you “want.” This means you must give yourself 
permission to dream, to risk. You must  set  yourself 
free. 
A ten or twenty percent improvement isn’t the idea 
at all. That would represent only incremental gains. 
That  might  be  an  impressive  performance  in  some 
situations,  like  if  there  were  unusual  obstacles  or  a 
very challenging set of circumstances. But while such 
a goal might be challenging, it would not represent a 
quantum leap. Instead of “an additional ten percent 
or  so,”  a  quantum  leap  produces  a  dramatic  and 
multiple  gain,  an  exponential  increase.  Quantum 
leaps  are  by  definition  rather  astounding,  certainly 
unconventional. 

you
2  
Price Pritchett 
Don’t get the idea that anything you can think of is 
possible.  But  in  some  areas  of  your  life  what  lies 
within your reach is enough to stagger the mind. You 
can double your level of success. Triple it. Far beyond 
that,  you  can  leverage  up  your  performance  to  the 
second or third or fourth power...or beyond. 
True, there are limits, but you don’t need to worry 
about  them.  Your  real  limits  are  far  beyond  your 
artificial mental boundaries. The real limits won’t box 
you  in,  but  the  false  one  you’re  carrying  around  in 
your mind are a self-imposed prison. 
So  how  do  you  break  out  of  this  jail?  Through 
surrender. 
You have to give up some of your old beliefs and 
sacrifice  some  of  those  “sensible”  thinking  patterns. 
So-called  common  sense  can  be  a  curse  that  puts  a

Suspend disbelief. 
Act as if your success is certain. 
Instead  of  holding  back  because  you  don’t  have 
hard proof that you can make a quantum leap, see if 
you  end  up  with  evidence  proving  you can’t.  Just 
make the jump—act as if your success is guaranteed—
and then see which set of ideas should you believe in. 
Your  mindset  for  the  moment  may  be  flawed  by 
doubt and skepticism. The idea of making a quantum 
leap in your performance, jumping from your present 
level  of  achievement  to one  several  stages  higher  in 
one  bold  stroke,  is  an  alien  idea.  You  haven’t  been 
trained  to  think  that  way.  You  may  have  definite 
reservations about the possibility that you can make 
such  exponential  improvement  at  all,  particularly 
with less effort and in an abbreviated time frame. 
The  experts  generally  agree,  though,  that  people 
typically  use  only  about  ten  percent  of  their  true 
potential.  If  we  accept  that  argument,  and  even  if 
there  were  no  other  resources  outside  yourself  that 
you  could  bring  to  bear  on  the  situation,  you  still 
could do ten times as well as you’ve been doing. 
Your  skepticism,  which  you  presume  is  based  on 
rational  thinking  and  on  objective  assessment  of 
factual data about yourself, is rooted in mental junk. 
Your doubts are not the product of accurate thinking, 
but habitual thinking. Years ago you accepted flawed 
conclusions  as  correct,  began  to  live  your  life  as if 
those  warped  ideas  about  your  potential  were  true, 
and ceased the bold experiment in living that brought 
you many breakthrough behaviors as a child. Now it’s 

you
2  
Price Pritchett 
time  for  you  to  find  that  faith  you  had  in  yourself 
before. 
If you want to be skeptical of some ideas that truly 
deserve  to  be  called  in  question,  challenge  the 
thoughts  and  beliefs  that  have  been  argued  against 
your taking a quantum leap. Put those old inhibiting 
ideas to the test by going for it with everything you’ve 
got. 
For  right  now  just  suspend  disbelief.  You  don’t 
have to be convinced that you can succeed in making 
a quantum leap, but don’t keep on believing those old 
ideas  you’ve  been  carrying  around  about  your 
personal limits. If it will make it easier, hold off for a 
while on believing anything. 
Just act  like  you  have  complete  faith.  Merely  do 
what  you’d  do  if  you  knew  you  were  going  to 
succeed. Behave like you have that total conviction. 
Doubt is what does the most damage. So don’t give 
it  any  mental  space.  Proceed  boldly,  as  if  it  is 
completely  inconceivable  that  you  will  experience 
anything other than a successful quantum leap. 
If you must doubt something, doubt your limits.

Focus  on  ends  rather  than 
means. 
You  don’t  have to  know  how  you’re  going to  get 
there, but you need to know where you want to go. 
It is crucial to have a crystal clear picture of what 
you  want  to  accomplish.  Operate  with  a  sharply 
defined mental image of the outcome you seek. Rivet 
your attention on the spot where you are to land at 
the end of your quantum leap. Visualize your arrival. 
When you do that, it’s like you “magnetize” yourself 
to the ways and means involved in the methodology 
for  getting  there.  The  solutions  begin  to  appear. 
Answers come to you. 
If you start worrying about everything that will be 
involved in getting from here to there, you are bound 
to bog down in the questions about the methodology. 
People always get hung up on the “how to” aspects 
regarding a quantum leap. 
Skip it! The answers will come to you. And when 
they  do,  you  probably  will  find  them  to  be  simple, 
streamlined solutions. 
See, a quantum leap is a move you’ve already prepared to 
make. You just haven’t done it yet. 
You have the potential, the resources are available, 
the  opportunity  is  there.  What  has  been  missing  is 
your decision to go for it. 
Maybe this will help you frame the situation a lot 
better.  The  quantum  leap  is  something  you’ve  been 
keeping from happening. It’s not something you have 

you
2  
Price Pritchett 
to struggle to make happen. You don’t really force it 
into existence...you just let it occur. The key is not to 
get in the way! 
A  quantum  leap  is  the  unexpected  that  comes  to 
you  with  sudden  grace.  You  can  open  yourself  to 
such a breakthrough, you can even invite it, but you 
can’t make it happen by struggling harder or insisting 
on first developing the perfect plan.

  is  achieved  through  an  intuitive,  instinctive 
discovery  process  based on  a  sense  of  direction  and 
action.  If  you  have  the  answers  and  structure  and 
certainly up front, it’s not a quantum leap. 
The  formula  does  not  involve  getting  everything 
neatly  organized  and  all  the  risks  eliminated  before 
you  make  the  move.  There’s  an  element  of  hip-
shooting involved here. Don’t count on having all the 
procedural  issues  for  the  journey  buttoned  down 
before you begin the trip. 
You  must  be  willing  to  tolerate  ambiguity, 
confusion,  possibly  even  chaos  for  a  while,  shaping 
your  game  plan  as  you  go.  Allow  some  disorder  in 
your life. 
If you get too concerned with the step-by-step plan 
of action to be followed, you’ll find yourself brooding 
over the potential problems and roadblocks that could 
be encountered. 
For  now  all  you  need  in  an  aiming  point,  and 
action.

A quantum leap, by definition, means moving into 
unchartered  territory  with  no  guide  to  follow.  You 
personally draw the map as you go. 
Look  at  it  this  way—you’re  not  supposed  to  be 
concerned  about  what  happens  in  the  middle  of  a 
jump...you’re  supposed  to  be  thinking  about  where 
you’re going to land. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The key is not to 
get in the way!

Rely on unseen forces. 
Improving  your  performance  by  an  order  of 
magnitude—you
2
—can sound unrealistic if you think 
of it as something you have to do all by yourself. 
But you don’t. 
Forget  the  idea  that  you  should  be  able  to  see, 
tangibly and in full view, all the resources necessary 
to leverage your performance dramatically. There are 
resources  you  can  access  that  cannot  be  seen,  and 
they  are  far  greater  and  more  powerful  than  the 
resources you might readily observe. 
Absence  of  evidence  is  not  evidence  of  their 
absence. Think of an iceberg, where you see only the 
tip of what’s really there. Just as real, though out of 
sight,  are  invisible  resources  ready  to  make  a 
profound difference in what you can achieve. All you 
have to do is open up and let them in. 
Quantum  leaps  are  merely  the  process  of  using 
yourself  and  your  world  differently,  thus allowing 
other  possibilities  that  exist  to  actually  materialize. 
Your willingness  to  make  a  quantum  leap  is  the 
enabler. 
You  do  not  achieve  your  dreams,  your  full 
potential,  through  your  own  singular  struggle.  As 
mentioned  earlier,  neither  raw  effort  nor  sheer 
willpower is the answer. “Trying as hard as you can” 
will  fall  far  short  of  taking  you  as  far  as  you  are 
capable  of  going.  You  must  take  advantage  of  the 
support systems you can’t see. 

you
2  
Price Pritchett 
In a sense, making the quantum leap is like playing 
bridge. You don’t bid your hand alone...your bidding 
is  also  based  on  the  power  of  your  partner’s  cards. 
You don’t really get to see those cards until it’s time 
to  play  them,  but  you  trust  that  they  will  bring 
valuable strength to your own hand. 
The unseen forces are phantom powers that cannot 
be  fully  explained.  Maybe  they  strike  you  as  rather 
mystical phenomena, but the truth is they will make 
amazing contributions to your efforts. These unseen 
forces  seem  to  operate  through  your  subconscious 
mind,  mental  imagery,  intuition  and  “luck.”  You 
might  be  hit  with  a  flash  of  inspiration  during  a 
moment of solitude. A creative solution to a problem 
may  come  to  you  in  a dream.  A  breakthrough  idea 
can flash through your mind while you’re visualizing 
your goal. Somehow the resources you need just seem 
to appear by coincidence. 
Paint a vivid picture in your mind for these forces to 
know  precisely  what  you  want.  In  one  way  or 
another, the unseen forces will dazzle you with their 
impact. Count on it. 
Quantum leaps come easy when you plug into this 
remarkable  power  source.  You  don’t  have  to 
understand  it  totally  in  order  to  use  it,  just  as  you 
don’t  have  to  comprehend  the  intricate  physics  of 
electrical energy to flip a lamp switch and flood the 
room with light. 
When  you  focus  constantly  on  a  clear  picture  of 
what  you  want  to  accomplish,  and  move  toward  it 
confidently,  the  unseen  forces  will  rally  to  your 
support.  These  unknowns,  these  invisible  resources,

making the quantum leap to you

Choose a different set of risks. 
Going for the quantum leap feels chancy. The risks 
hit  you  as  rather  apparent,  and  may  be  quite 
threatening, but you must stack them up against the 
hidden risks you accept when you decide to live with 
the status quo. 
Ask yourself what you’re risking if you do not go 
for the quantum leap. The risk is that you won’t get 
what you really want out of life. 
You’ve got to understand that you can never escape 
risk. It’s not something you can decide to live with or 
without. Something is always at stake. You can only 
decide which risks to take. 
Whether you choose to go for the quantum leap, or 
to  follow  your  usual  routines,  you  are  putting 
something on the line. So choose carefully, and don’t 
kid  yourself  with  the  idea  that  “playing  it  safe”  by 
living  with  the  status  quo  gives  you  the  best  odds. 
That may be the surest way of losing. 
Quantum  leaps  do mean  that  to  some degree  you 
must move beyond the zone of familiarity, security, 
and  comfort.  But  you  can  make  the  jump  to you
2
 
without being reckless or impulsive. 
Frankly,  making  a  quantum  leap  is  not  mere 
gambling. It’s not a crapshoot. You simply move on 
an  opportunity  you’ve  been  ignoring.  You  abandon 
your excuses. You reframe the problem. You take a 
completely different chance. A quantum leap is risking 
in  a way  that unmasks  the  truth,  revealing  how  the 

you
2  
Price Pritchett 
only  thing  of  significance  that  has  been  standing  in 
the way is you. 
Risk  believing  in  yourself.  Risk  acting  on  the 
assumption  that  you  can  succeed  in  making  a 
quantum  leap.  Otherwise,  the  risk  is  that  you  will 
settle for only a fraction of what life has to give you. 
This isn’t a case of taking a big chance, it’s a matter 
of giving yourself a big chance. 
The major obstacle to overcoming the odds is never 
challenging them. Until you test the limits regarding 
what  you  can  achieve,  you  can’t  truly  know  what 
your chances really are. And the odds change in your 
favor when you begin to challenge them. 
But  if  you  try  to  minimize  your  vulnerability  by 
avoiding a new set of risks, you kill your chances for a 
quantum leap.

overcoming the odds is

Trust in the power of pursuit. 
You’ve dreamed many dreams that were yours for 
the taking. In fact, almost all of them were well within 
your  reach.  Even  now,  most  of  what  you  dream  of 
can be yours. 
The  simple  secret  is  the  seeking. Pursuit!  Dreams 
begin to crystallize into reality when they are pursued. 
The  world  behaved  differently  when  you  actually 
take action to go after what you want. What you wish 
“could be” starts becoming. The dream moves in your 
direction, begins to come to you, even as you reach 
for it. 
Consider this—the dreams you have realized in life 
are those which you actively sought. That which you 
have achieved is what you decided to go for in one 
way  or  another.  You  can  “think  positively”  all  day 
long, all year, but positive action is what counts. 
Wishing, longing, wanting, desiring...these are not 
the  same  as  pursuing  a  dream.  These  are  mental 
states, and can play an important role in the process 
of  becoming you
2
.  But  they  are  essentially  passive. 
Pursuit,  on  the  other  hand,  is  active.  Reaching  for 
your dream is behaving—moving—and it shortens the 
distance between you and your desired objective. 
Most  people  confuse  wishing  and  wanting  with 
pursuing. Their desire for a dream may be desperate 
and deep. But when that desire fails to produce, they 
conclude  the  dream  cannot  be  theirs.  Actually,  the 
only proof they have is that the longing is not enough. 

you
2  
Price Pritchett 
The data at hand merely prove that desire alone does 
not—cannot—deliver. 
Pursuit is what makes the difference. Reaching for 
what  you  want  alters  the  odds  immediately,  and 
drastically, of  getting  it. “What  you  want” becomes 
part of a dynamic exchange, with the world and you 
in  partnership,  when  you  act  and  extend  yourself 
toward the dream. 
you
2
  is  firmly  based  on  the  premise  of  pursuit. 
Quantum leaps require you to take the offensive. You 
can’t achieve exponential gains in your success from a 
defensive  posture.  You  can’t  remain  in  a  passive 
stance and make a quantum jump. 
You  must  move  on  the  dream.  That  means  you 
must leave the cover, the safety, that goes with merely 
wishing for something. You must place your trust in 
action. 
Ask...seek...knock...and the dream shall be yours. 
 
 
 
Most people confuse 
wishing and wanting 
with pursuing. 
You must place your trust 
in action. 

you
2  
Price Pritchett 
Seek failure. 
Quantum  leaps  demand  a  willingness  to  make 
mistakes. 
You  cannot  hole  up  in  the  safe  zone  of  behavior 
where  you  have  beaten  the  odds  of  failing.  An 
unwillingness  to  encounter  defeat  or  run  into  the 
problems  outlaws  quantum  leaps.  Unless  you  allow 
yourself to make mistakes, to fail, you will never have 
the opportunity to test the limits of what you truly are 
capable of accomplishing. 
You  must  realize  that  if  you’re  experiencing  no 
difficulties,  problems,  or  pain,  you  probably  have 
aimed too low. You’ve leveled off in your growth and 
achievement.  You  probably  are  far  from  reaching 
your limits. 
So  think  of  problems  or  pain  or  slippage  in 
performance  as  a  positive  sign.  A  performance  lag 
ordinarily  occurs  at  the  very  outset  when  you  are 
making a quantum leap. It’s the pause during which 
you  poise  for  the  jump,  the  temporary  loss  of 
momentum  that  occurs  in  the  process  of  “changing 
gears.” 
You  deliberately  destabilize  yourself  when  you 
break out of the habit patterns that represent the status 
quo. You create some inner chaos for yourself. So be 
prepared for the possibility of confusion, anxiety and 
failure. That’s part of opening yourself up to a new 
methodology  that  has  the  potential  to  deliver 
exponential performance gains. 

you
2  
Price Pritchett 
So often in life, it seems things first get worse on the 
way toward getting better. Be prepared for that sort of 
development.  Problems  belong  in  the  process.  They 
are part of the equation that produces you
2
. They are 
not  proof  that  your  ambitions  are  futile  or  that  you 
should give up. 
As  someone  has  said,  “Everything  looks  like  a 
failure in the middle.” You can’t bake a cake without 
getting the kitchen messy. Halfway through surgery it 
looks  like  there’s  been  a  murder  in  the  operating 
room. If you send a rocket toward the moon, about 
ninety percent of the time it’s off course—it “fails” its 
way to the moon by continually making mistakes and 
correcting them. 
At the outset you may feel high because going for 
the quantum is heady stuff. But then the hard reality 
of  “problems”  may  slap  you  in  the  face.  Progress 
often masquerades as trouble. 
It’s  easy  to  lose  faith,  because  other  people  may 
withdraw their support and be critical of your efforts. 
That, plus your own anxieties and uncertainties, can 
tempt you to turn on yourself. 
This is the critical point in the progress—don’t give 
up! Failure belongs here. It’s a sign of progress! 
The  stress  will  seduce  you  toward  retreat  to  the 
“safety” of the status quo, the trap of the familiar. Just 
remember  this:  Failure  does  not  mean  you’re 
defeated. 
Actually,  the  struggle  gives  you  strength.  It’s  like 
tempering  the  steel,  or  the  soreness  involved  in 

you
2  
Price Pritchett 
developing muscle. The difficulties are just evidence 
that you’re learning and progressing. 
So  go  looking  for  failure...and  then  use  it.  Don’t 
interpret  problems  or  breakdowns  as  proof  that  you 
should quit, but instead take them as evidence if your 
growth and improvement. 
Failure is a resource. It helps you find the edge of 
your capacities.

Get uncomfortable. 
Quantum leaps jerk you out of your comfort zone. 
Prepare yourself for a pretty wild ride. You’re going 
to  cover  some  unfamiliar  terrain  and  encounter 
obstacles you’ve never faced before. It can feel like the 
safety  chain  linking  you  with  behavior  patterns  that 
worked in the past is being stretched to the limit. At 
times you may wonder if the situation is about to spin 
out of control. 
The normal reaction is to want to hold on tightly. 
But  you’re  going  to  have  to  learn  to  let  go. you
2
  is 
achieved through release. 
So turn loose if you want to jump. 
Don’t  be  surprised  if  you  grow  uneasy—that’s  a 
predictable  part  of  the  process.  When  you  take  the 
quantum  leap  you ride  the  situation,  but  you  don’t 
really control  it  all  that  much.  In  fact,  the  only  way 
you control it is by (1) knowing where you’re going, 
(2) continuing the pursuit, and (3) learning from your 
mistakes. 
A quantum leap is an act of faith, exhilarating and 
possibly scary at the same time. You have to give up a 
large  degree  of  security  and  safety,  plow  through 
greater  amounts  of  ambiguity  and  confusion  and 
uncertainty,  wrestle  with  a  totally  new  set  of 
problems,  invite  failure,  and  possibly  contend  with 
criticism  from  other  people  who  have  been  part  of 
your support group in the past. 
Make you uncomfortable? 

you
2  
Price Pritchett 
That’s a good sign. 
If you’re experiencing no anxiety or discomfort, the 
risk you’re taking probably isn’t worthy of you. The 
only risks that aren’t a little scary are the ones you’ve 
outgrown.  A  high  comfort  level  provides  solid 
evidence  that  you’re  “playing  it  safe,”  not  growing, 
not  really  testing  your  limits  at  all,  and  not  in  the 
process  of  a  quantum  leap.  You  might  be  making 
gradual  progress—that’s  possible—but  you’re  not 
going for a breakthrough. 
you
2
  carries  you  beyond  your  commonplace, 
everyday habits and calls for little more nerve. So just 
go into this expecting a touch of anxiety. Uneasiness 
is  a  predictable  psychological  reaction  when  a 
quantum leap is under way. 
It  has  been  said  that  if  you  will  do  the  thing  you 
fear,  death  of  fear  is  certain.  Courage  is  not  the 
absence of fear and anxiety, it’s proceeding in spite of 
those feelings. 
So press on.

Open your gifts. 
You  have  many  gifts  that  you’ve  never  opened. 
These are gifts of talent, ability, and “reach” that are 
yours for the taking. 
The  people  we  call  gifted  are  different  from  the 
crowd in one very special way. They accepted their 
gifts.  They  “let  it  happen.”  The  high  achievers,  the 
persons  you  admire,  are  those  individuals  who 
opened  their  gifts.  These  winners  have  more  gifts 
because  they  claimed  them,  took  them  out  of  the 
wrapping, and used them. 
Now  it’s  time  for  you  to  do  something  with  your 
gifts.  Claim  them,  and  you  create  them.  Reach  for 
them, and they materialize. Use them, and they grow 
to serve you still better. 
If  you  look  at  those  particular  skills  you  have 
developed  over  the  years,  the  talents  that  you  have 
exhibited, you will find they are the gifts you opened 
and enjoyed. 
But how many others are there within your reach? 
For every gift you’ve opened over the years, there are 
hundreds that you’ve never unwrapped and taken out 
of the package. This unused potential hides there, just 
waiting to play a role in your quantum leap. 
When you make a quantum leap you find out many 
new  things  about  yourself. you

a metamorphosis.

Think of a striped caterpillar humbly crawling along 
the  stem  of  a  milkweed  plant  a  few  inches  from 
Mother  Earth,  changing  into  a  strikingly  beautiful 
monarch  butterfly  that  soars  high  in  the  air  and 
bravely  journeys  thousands  of  miles  in  its  yearly 
pilgrimage.  To  become  a  monarch,  to  free  those 
shining  auburn  wings,  to  fly  high  and  free,  the 
creature must break out of the cocoon of safety and 
open its gifts. 
Open some more of yours. Find your wings.

Fall in love. 
Quantum  leaps  won’t  happen  if  you’re  living  life 
with a lukewarm heart. 
Passion  is  a  very  important part  of  the process.  It 
fires the soul and fills the spirit, energizing your heart 
and mind for the quantum leap to a higher plane of 
performance.  Passion  also  keeps  you  going  when 
you’re hit with problems and uncertainty. 
But passion itself must be fueled, and you feed that 
flame with visions of a dream that is dramatic. The 
emotional  intensity  inside  must  burn  hot  enough  to 
protect  you  against  the  chilling  effects  of  doubt, 
uncertainty,  criticism,  and  failure.  Only  deep  desire 
can generate such heat. 
For you to care this intensely, of course, there must 
be  something  worth  caring  about—something 
remarkable, special, and precious enough to light the 
fire in your heart. 
This  means  you  must  loosen  the  limits  on  your 
thinking, and give yourself permission to pursue what 
you  want  most.  The  climate  is  right  for  a  quantum 
leap  only  when  you  are  passionately  drawn  to  a 
particular goal. 
So let your deepest desires direct your aim. Set your 
sights far above the “reasonable” target. The power of 
purpose is profound only if you have a desire that stirs 
the heart. 
The inner drive must be strong enough to carry you 
past  the  point  of  wishful  thinking.  The  dream  must 

you
2  
Price Pritchett 
consume  you,  control  you,  drive  you  to  action, 
disallowing halfhearted effort in the pursuit. 
Quantum  leaps  are  an  act  of  love,  a  passionate 
statement  of  how  you  care  for  the  thing  you  seek. 
Only  an  emotional  move  holds  the  power  to  carry 
you the distance from you to you
2

Let the heart take charge of your body. If you have 
a  “magnificent  obsession,”  you  are  poised  for  a 
quantum leap.

Make your move before you’re 
ready. 
Don’t  bog  down  in  getting  prepared  for  this. 
Whatever else you need will come as you go. 
A  person  could  make  a  career  out  of  laying  the 
groundwork  to  do  something  really  big.  Please 
understand—you don’t “prepare” for a quantum leap. 
You make it, and then fine tune your approach. You 
go for it, instead of forever getting ready so you will 
be  sure  to  get  in  right.  “Zero  defects”  is  a  hostile 
concept in the pursuit of you
2
. 
First you act, then you frame out the details of your 
strategy.  Move  on  your  dream...start...and  let  what 
happens  help  you  develop  a  coherent  game  plan. 
Mobility is the crucial element. Strategy formulation 
then evolves naturally out of your discovery process. 
You’ll discover, once underway, that you know more 
than you know you know. Just trust your instincts. 
Once  again, a  quantum  leap  is  something  you  are 
already prepared to do! It’s not some absurd, wild-eyed 
scheme that calls for a fantastic stroke of luck just to 
have  an  outside  chance  of  working.  It’s  not  an 
example of your reach exceeding your grasp. And it’s 
most definitely not a matter of going for some grand 
goal that calls for painstaking preparation. 
A  quantum  leap  is  a  move  that  is  yours  for  the 
taking. Right now. It represents a giant step you can 
make merely by deciding to and opening yourself up 
to the resources presently available to serve you.

Everything  else  that’s  needed,  right  now,  comes 
from inside of you. The opportunity, the timing, the

situation. 
The  formula  for you
2
,  the  strategy  for  making  the 
quantum leap, has been covered here. You have those 
answers. The answers to questions that remain must 
come from the voice within. Now you must listen to 
yourself. Those are the sounds no one else can hear. 
Your dreams, your desires, the thoughts that burn 
the hottest in your mind, they carry the messages that 
help you find your own “magnetic north.” They point 
the way toward the breakthrough to you

Look inside at what pulls at your consciousness, for 
there you’ll find direction. 
Everything else is in position. Waiting for you.

INTRODUCTION 
It is generally agreed that a strong brand can be a valuable asset, yielding sales and profits over 
what would be achieved by a similar, generic product, and that marketing plays an important role 
in  creating  that  value  through  its  influence  on  consumer  behavior.  However,  to  the  outsider  
branding  and  the  practice  of  marketing  can  seem  complex,  obscure,  and  sometimes faddish.  In  
part, that is because, unlike the physical sciences,  some of the basic principles have yet to be fully 
understood and agreed. 
 
MARKETING IS AN EVOLVING PRACTICE 
Marketing has been practiced in one form or another for millennia, but only evolved to influence 
mass-market consumer behavior following the Industrial Revolution. Since then, the practice has 
continued to evolve in response to changes in culture, media, and technology. The advent of TV 
and  then  the  Internet  have  marked  dramatic  transitions  in  the  practice  of  marketing,  and  
marketers  are  still  trying  to  figure  out  best  practices in  a  digital  world.  Marketing  theory  has  
evolved in  parallel, seeking  to  codify  the  principles  and  practices  of  marketing  and  drawing  on  
other areas of study such as behavioral economics and neuroscience.  
 
SUFFERING FROM A LACK OF CONSISTENCY 
Today, there is still debate in both professional and academic circles as to how marketing really 
works, and, unlike science or the law, the language of marketing is often ill-defined and open to 
interpretation. As a result, practitioners are free to create their own paradigm of how marketing 
works and what marketing activities will be most effective. 
 
To  better  manage  the  marketing  process,  many  large  companies  have  implemented  their  own 
marketing  frameworks,  practices,  and  protocols.  However,  while  these  frameworks  may  share  
many commonalities, they often differ in terms of execution and terminology, which makes it even 
harder to the outsider to figure out what marketers are talking about. 
 
THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS DOCUMENT 
This  document  attempts  to  clarify  the  basic  principles  of  branding  and  marketing  as  practiced  
today,  exploring  commonly  used  marketing  concepts  and  terminology,  and  show  how  
sustainability initiatives might fit with those activities. 
 
The  basic  assumption  adopted  throughout  the  review  is  that  we  are  dealing  with  a  for-profit 
company  that  will  prioritize  sustainability  only if  it  helps  generate  stronger  sales  growth,  yields  
better margins, or mitigates a downside risk to sales. Many marketers might desire to be seen to 
make a positive difference in the world but will be limited by the basic financial objectives of the 
company for which they work.

BRANDING 
WHAT IS A BRAND? 
There are two sides to any brand:  
1. The tangible assets that the brand owner controls, including the product or products, the 
design,  customer  service,  marketing  communications, packaging, brand  name  and  logo. 
Depending  on  the  nature  of  the  company,  the  brand  could  be  synonymous  with  the  
company or applied to a specific product offered by that company.  
2. The intangible value created by the brand for potential buyers, which makes them more 
likely  to  choose  the  brand  and  pay  the  price  asked.  That  consumer value  rests  in  the  
associations, expectations and emotions created by indirect learning, e.g., through word 
of mouth or advertising, and direct consumption experience. In other words, the brand is 
how people perceive and interpret everything the company does.  
 
The  sustainability  initiatives  a  company  pursues  will  have  an  influence  on  its  brand(s)  provided  
potential consumers know about them and can readily appreciate the benefits of those activities. 
 
A BRAND’S VALUE RESTS IN THE VALUE IT CREATES FOR BUYERS 
By creating value for customers –  even if it is only a convenient way to solve a need –  brands create 
value  for  their  owners.  People  are  more  likely  to  choose  familiar  and  desirable  brands  than  
unfamiliar ones. They are often willing to pay more money for brands that they find different and 
desirable. 
 
While there is growing concern over sustainability among the general public, to date only a small 
minority have  proved  willing  to  pay  more  for  a  sustainable  product. This  is  in  part  because  the  
majority of  people  do  not  feel  sustainability  is  of  immediate  and  personal  relevance  (no  matter  
what the scientific evidence). In a recent Kantar survey, 82% of people agreed that when people 
shop,  their  mind  is  on  saving  money  more  than  saving  the  planet.  However,  when  a  product  is 
priced on a par with alternatives, then sustainable credentials can prove the tipping point in favor 
of purchase for more people. And as more companies move to make their products and services 
sustainable, more people are likely to act in favor of the brands they perceive to be doing the right 
thing for the planet.  
 
Today,  brands  are  often  included  as  an  asset  on  the  balance  sheet,  and  companies  will  seek  to 
quantify  that  value,  particularly  when  contemplating  the sale  or  acquisition  of  a  specific  brand. 
However,  separating  the  tangible  and  intangible  value  of  a  brand  is  a  complex  and  often  
judgmental  process.  Companies  like  Interbrand,  Kantar,  and  Brand  Finance have  created  third  
party brand valuation systems, which provide a useful and accessible means of judging a brand’s 
value, but of necessity these systems are relatively simplistic and rely on different data sets, which 
may result in different values being assigned to the same brand. 
 
THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT SUSTAINABILITY IS OF GROWING IMPORTANCE TO BRANDS 
The Kantar  BrandZ  Most  Valuable  Global  Brands  2020 report  finds  that  brands  with  a  high  
reputation  for  sustainability  are  worth  more  and  grow  faster  than  those  with  a  low  reputation.  
And  an  analysis  conducted  by  the  University  of  Oxford’s  Saïd  Business  School,  finds  that  

 
5 
perceptions of environmental, social, and employee responsibility are one of the factors that help 
drive profit over and above those predicted by standard financial models. 
 
BRANDS ARE RESILIENT 
Brand resilience refers to the ability of a brand to resist external shocks that might affect people’s 
willingness to buy a brand. Contrast these two historic examples, 
• Between  2009  and  2011,  Toyota  recalled  millions  of  vehicles  in  response  to  complaints  
over sudden acceleration, including a reported 89 deaths. In 2011, Toyota’s market share 
dropped almost 2 percentage points but recovered most of the loss the following year.  
• A decade earlier, Firestone and Ford were involved in a controversy over tire failures and 
rollovers  affecting  the  Ford  Explorer,  reported  to  have  resulted  in  271  deaths.  This  cost 
Bridgestone, owner of the Firestone brand, billions, caused it market price to fall by over 
half, and resulted in a decline in consumer demand for the Firestone brand. 
 
One  of  the  reasons  that  Toyota  was  relatively  unscathed,  and  Firestone  was  not,  is  due  to  the  
strength  of  their  brands.  Toyota  had  a  strong  reputation  for  quality  and  reliability.  By  contrast,  
Firestone was not that well-known or trusted.  
 
Brands often prove to be more resilient than expected. In part this is because unless there is some 
direct, personal threat, people can easily shrug off or ignore a crisis. Another reason is that it takes 
time for the downside risk of a crisis to become fully apparent. Even if Toyota owners had decided 
not  to  buy  that  brand  again,  it  might  have  taken  years  for  them  to  get  round  to  buying  a  
replacement vehicle, by which time memories of the crisis would have faded. Attitudes to brands 
are  forged  over  decades  and  it  takes  a  lot  to  change  them.  The  biggest  risk  to  a  brand  is  that  a  
competitor innovates first and disrupts the category. 
 
FAILURE TO INNOVATE CREATES BRAND RISK 
According  to  Kantar,  61%  of  consumers  believe  sustainability  is  the  responsibility  of  businesses  
and producers. Not living up to those expectations poses a risk, particularly if a competitor makes 
sustainability  an  advantage  for  their  brand.  And  brand  can  suffer  when  called  out  over  
greenwashing.  For  instance,  prior  to  its  diesel  emissions  scandal,  VW  had  advertised  the  
“greenness” of its diesel vehicles in the USA, likely exacerbating the negative consumer response 
to the scandal. While the scandal’s  impact on vehicle sales was largely short-term, the cost to VW 
in fines and settlements is estimated to have cost over $35 billion, and, according to Kantar BrandZ, 
VW’s brand value dropped by around half and has yet to recover to its 2015 level. 
 

 
6 
FAILURE TO INNOVATE IS A SUBSTANTIAL RISK TO BRAND VALUE 
 
 
As yet, sustainability has not created substantial brand risk (as opposed to business risk) but with 
sustainability growing in importance to consumers so too does the risk of not being seen to do the 
right  thing.  Many  large  companies  have  sought  to  mitigate  that risk  by  buying  small,  more  
sustainable or environmentally friendly companies.  
 
THE IMPORTANCE OF BRAND VARIES BY INDUSTRY 
The  degree  to  which  a  company  derives  value  from  its  brand  will  depend  on  the  nature  of  its  
industry.  Consumer-facing  goods  like  soft  drinks  are  highly  dependent  on  their  brand,  because  
they  serve  a  generic  need  for  refreshment  and  brand  choice  often  comes  down  to  habit  and  
intuitive  choices.  IT  infrastructure  companies  are  far  more  dependent  on  their  IP  and  technical  
expertise than their brand because customer needs are more complex, varied and the purchase 
process  is  more  deliberative.  Unfortunately,  businesses  engaged  in  primary  resource  extraction  
are probably least reliant on their brand to generate financial value.  
 
MOST MARKETERS ARE SEEKING MARKET SHARE GROWTH 
A brand may grow because sales of the category are growing, but overall sales in most categories 
are flat. In that case, to grow sales, brands must compete for market share – the proportion of 
total category sales they account for. However, there are two basic classifications of market share: 
volume and value. The first represents a share of units sold and the second is weighted by price. 
Importantly, the latter is predictive of profit and brand value.  
 
Given  that  measuring  brand  value  is  a  complex  and  time-consuming  business,  most  marketers  
default to using market share as a proxy for financial value. However, too often the default is to 
use volume market share because it is simpler. Unfortunately, this prioritizes unprofitable growth 
and  consumes  resources  unnecessarily.  Companies  that  want  to  be  more  sustainable  would  do  
better to focus on growing value market share. 
 

 
7 
Given  the  importance  of  market  share  to  measuring  the  impact  of  marketing,  it  is  important  to  
identify  how  sustainability  initiatives  might  “ladder  up”  to  impact  market  share,  a  topic  we  will  
discuss later in this document.  
 
BRAND SIZE MATTERS 
At a very basic level brands generate sales by being easy to mind, easy to find, and easy to pay. 
That  is,  potential  buyers  must  think  of  the  brand  when  a  need  arises  and  the  brand  is  available  
when and where the buyer wants, and at a price they are willing or able to pay. 
 
This means big brands have inherent advantages over small ones because they are both easy to 
mind and easy to find. Easy to mind because a big brand is likely to be a habitual or obvious choice 
for many people, and likely has a big marketing budget help bring in new customers. Easy to find 
because  the  brand  will  be  widely  available  and  have  more  shelf  space  or  stores  than  the  
competition. The payoff to being easy to find is that if someone has little idea which brand they 
want to buy, or the brand they want is unavailable, they will likely go with the most easily available 
alternative.  
 
New or small brands, on the other hand, are at a disadvantage. Even if they have a great product, 
one that is demonstrably better than the alternatives, they may not be well-known, and they are 
unlikely  to  have  widespread  distribution.  While  online  recommendation  engines,  customer  
reviews, and search have made it easier to find small and niche brands, lack of familiarity will still 
create a barrier to purchase. Even if someone wants to buy a small brand, they may not be able to 
find it in the store or want to order online, and default to buying an alternative. Particularly when 
a small brand is distributed through grocery stores or other third-party retailers, the brand is going 
to have to first prove that it can generate sales, then it can start to bootstrap its growth by ramping 
up its marketing spend and availability. 
 
The problem with many sustainable or eco-friendly brands is that they are often priced higher than 
the mainstream and tend to have smaller market shares, making them both less easy to mind and 
less easy to find.

MARKETING 
MARKETING’S OBJECTIVE IS TO CREATE ADDITIONAL VALUE 
The  objective  of  marketing  is  to  create  additional  consumer  value  by  creating, investing  in,  and 
deploying brand assets to build sales and profit, either by creating a lasting desire to choose the 
brand, or influencing behavior more directly during the purchase process. 
 
MARKETERS GROW VALUE BY GROWING SALES 
Most marketers see their primary objective as growing sales, usually by acquiring new customers. 
Every brand will gain and lose customers over time and marketing’s job is to help ensure that the 
gains  outweigh  the  losses.  Additionally,  some  companies  will  focus  on  developing  new  
consumption  occasions  or  reducing  price  elasticity  (making  sales  less  responsive  to  changes  in  
price, which should help improve profits). 
 
MARKETING AMPLIFIES BRAND VALUE 
The  effect  of  marketing  is  not  independent  of  the  brand  and  product  being  advertised.  As  
advertising guru David Ogilvy is reputed to have said, “Great marketing only makes a bad product 
fail faster.” What marketing does is amplify what the brand offers and stands for. 
 
Marketing aims to ensure that people will think of the brand when it comes time for them to buy, 
and  by  improving  the  saleability  of  a  brand,  marketing  helps  increase  the  number  of  sales  than  
would have been made otherwise. 
 
MARKETING IS A SHARE GAME 
Marketing  is  inherently  competitive,  a  zero-sum  game.  As  noted  above,  one  of  the  key  metrics  
marketers pay attention to is market share. Market share is based on sales, but depending on the 
product  category  and  marketing  task,  brands  may  also  compete  for  share  of  wallet,  e.g.,  a  
proportion of someone’s disposable income, share of throat, e.g., the proportion of total beverage 
consumption, or share of occasion, e.g., the proportion of breakfast sales. 
 
MARKETING SUCCESS OFTEN REQUIRES A TRIPLE WIN 
Consumer-focused  companies  that  must  work  through  retailers  will  have  to  do  more  than  just  
please  end-consumers.  Retailers  often  prioritize  growing  category  sales  rather  than  sales  of  a  
specific  brand,  so  marketers  must  ensure  that  any  marketing  campaign  is  expected  to  increase  
overall category sales. So, a successful campaign likely needs to take account of the needs of the 
brand owner, the retailer, and the shopper.  
 
THE MARKETING MIX REFERS TO THE BASIC GROWTH LEVERS 
The  marketing  mix  is  composed  of  the  basic  levers  that  marketing  can  use  to  drive  sales.  Often 
referred to as the 4P’s: product, price, place, and promotion. 
 

 
9 
HOW THE 4PS INFLUENCE SALES & BRAND VALUE 
 
Over the years various other P’s have been proposed, notably including people – to encompass 
the importance of customer service and employee commitment – packaging –  obviously important 
to products sold on grocery shelves - and purpose – more on this below.  
 
MARKETING’S RESPONSIBILITY VARIES BY COMPANY 
The degree to which marketing directly controls or is involved with any P apart from promotion 
will  vary  by  industry  and  company. In  consumer-focused  companies,  marketing  will  likely  be  
involved with all four, from identifying a consumer need that could be satisfied, helping to design 
the  product,  then  figuring  out  how  to  price  it,  where  to  sell  it  and  how  best  to  promote  it.  A  
company  like  Diageo,  selling  brands  like  Johnnie  Walker,  Guinness,  and  Smirnoff,  regards  its  
brands  as  critical  to  growing  sales  and  profits.  As  a  result,  marketing  has  more  control  over  all  
aspects  of  the  marketing  mix  and  the  company  invests  heavily  in  market  research  to  better  
understand consumer behavior and attitudes. 
 
By  contrast,  in  tech-focused  companies,  marketing’s  role  may  be  limited  solely  to  promotion.  A 
company  like  Dell  will  likely  prioritize  R&D  and  product  innovation,  leaving  the  marketers  to  
publicize  the  resulting  new  products  as  best  they  can.  Apple’s  Steve  Jobs  famously  refused  to  
conduct consumer research (a normal part of product development) because he believed ordinary 
people could not anticipate what they wanted until they were shown it. 
 
Particularly withing global companies marketing may be broken up to focus on specific areas of 
brand  growth.  There  may  be  a  central  brand  development  team  that  designs  the  overall  brand  
strategy  and  is  responsible  for  developing  global  marketing  campaigns,  an  innovation  center  
focused  on  product  innovation,  and  market  or  country  specific  units  devoted  to  local  brand  
marketing and implementation of the overall campaign.  
 

 
10 
THE MARKETING PROCESS (IN THEORY) 
START WITH THE CUSTOMER 
It is generally understood that marketing starts with the end-customer: the people who are going 
to  buy  and  use  the  brand  (note,  they  may  not  be  the  same  people).  So,  when  seeking  to  
incorporate  sustainability  into  a  marketing  campaign  it  is  important  to  know  how  the  end-
consumer is likely to feel about it. 
 
The idea is to start with a good understanding of why people buy or do not buy your brand and 
then  work  back,  identifying  new  opportunities  for  growth  and things  that  either facilitate  a  
purchase or  create  a  barrier  to  purchase.  The  marketer  then  seeks  to  find  ways  to  seize  the  
opportunities, leverage  things that facilitate purchase, and remove the barriers. Given that brands 
are  competing  for  sales,  marketers  must  seek  to  be  more  effective  at  doing  so  than  their  
competition. 
 
DEVELOP A BRAND STRATEGY 
Effective  marketing  starts  with  a  good  understanding  of  the  current  status  of  the  brand  in  its  
marketplace and compared to its competition: strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. 
A  brand’s  specific  strategy  will  depend  on  the  current status  of  the  brand  with  customers  in  its 
product category, taking account of its competitive and cultural context, and will define how the 
brand aims to maximize sales growth over the long-term utilizing the resources available to it. 
 
However, we can identify three basic strategies, each of which will demand effective execution of 
a specific set of activities to achieve its objective: 
 
1. Disruptive growth 
Radical  innovation,  be  it  in  product,  sales  channel,  customer  service,  purpose,  or  
positioning, which the end-customer is likely to find differentiating and personally relevant, 
offers the best opportunity to disrupt the status quo and grow the category and/or gain 
market  share.  The  basic  challenge  is  to  ensure  that  people  who  might  want  to  buy  the  
category  know  what  the  brand  has  to  offer  and  why  it  might  be  relevant  to  them.  
Sustainability  initiatives  might  offer  the  potential  for  disruption,  provided  they  are  
perceived as meaningful by the end-consumer, e.g., create a better product experience or 
stronger emotional benefit. Method disrupted the household cleaning category by offering 
an alternative to harsh chemicals (its success was also dependent on its design aesthetic) 
and triggered a wave of innovation and acquisition by established manufacturers.  
 
2. Incremental growth 
Most product categories end up in a state of equilibrium: overall sales are flat, competition 
for  market  share  has  resulted  in  stalemate,  and  the  only  real  advantage  is  brand  size.  
Growth is the result of identifying incremental growth opportunities, e.g., a grocery retailer 
might  try  to  attract  wealthier  customers  by  stocking  its  own  line  of  quality  wines,  and  
seeking  less  tangible  advantages,  e.g.,  advertising  the  brand’s  purpose to  help  improve  
desirability. Brands are most likely to benefit from highlighting their brand purpose if they 
are  created  with  purpose  “baked  in,”  like  Method,  Seventh  Generation,  and  Allbirds.  
However, an established brand can adopt a purpose to good effect, provided the chosen 
purpose is authentic to its heritage and positioning and the brand is willing to deliver on 

 
11 
that purpose. Many established brands have made a start down this road, e.g., Coca-Cola’s 
plant-based  bottle,  IKEA’s  buyback  scheme,  or  Tom’s  of  Maine  adopting  recyclable  
packaging for its toothpaste.  
 
3. Return to growth 
The  brand  is  out  of  step  with  the  times,  the  competition  has  changed  the  playing  field,  
sales are in decline, margins are weak, and people are losing interest in what the brand has 
to offer. Time to find a way to revive the brand. The strategy must be to fix the basics of 
the business, redress product issues, and then publicize what has been done to give new 
and  past  customers  a  reason  to  reconsider  their  brand  choice.  New,  more  sustainable,  
product formulations and packaging, may be part of the solution. 
 
Sustainability can be integral to all three of these strategies, but remember, it depends on whether 
you can make the end-consumer care enough to change their buying behavior.  
 
CREATE A BRAND POSITIONING 
Ultimately, brands provide a solution to people’s needs, want, and desires. Brands must solve the 
need for which people buy them, i.e., brands offer a functional benefit. But particularly when there 
are  multiple  brands  that  might  meet  someone’s  needs,  brands  must  address  more  emotional  
needs, i.e., brands offer an emotional benefit. The balance of importance of function and emotion 
will vary by brand and category, but the strongest brands  offer both. 
 
Given the competitive nature of most product categories, marketers focus on how their brand can 
gain  competitive  advantage  versus  the  competition.  The  key  question  is  why  might  someone  
choose this brand instead of its competition? The answer might be rooted in a product advantage 
or an emotional advantage and is often referred to as the brand positioning, and often extends to 
include  a  definition  of  the  people  most  likely  to  choose  the  brand  (the  target  audience),  the  
functional and emotional advantages that make the brand desirable, the values the brand seeks 
to stand for, and its tone of voice. 
 
A brand’s positioning is considered important because it helps a brand keep its marketing activities 
focused  and  consistent and  most  companies  will  have  a  formal  document  that  details  the  
important  aspects  of  a  brand’s  positioning.  Sustainability  may  be  either  explicitly  or  implicitly  
called out as an aspect of the brand positioning and is most likely to be included explicitly if the 
brand has adopted a clear purpose (next section). 
 
ADOPT A BRAND PURPOSE 
Related to brand positioning, brand purpose is a relatively new concept in marketing, its popularity 
dating  from  dating from 2011, when  Jim  Stengel’s  book  “Grow:  How  Ideals  Power  Growth  and  
Profit at the World's Greatest Companies” was first published. 
 
Stengel served as the global marketing officer of Procter & Gamble from 2001 to 2008, lending 
credibility  to  his  idea  that  the  most  successful  brands  served  a  purpose  beyond  simply  making  
money,  by  connecting  with  fundamental  human  emotions,  values,  and  wider  purposes.  For 
instance, Pampers’  purpose  was  to  help  mothers  raise  happy,  healthy  babies.  In  contrast  to  

 
12 
Pampers, the purpose of a brand like Dyson household appliances is purely functional, focused on 
efficiency.  
 
So,  all  brands  need  a  purpose,  but  some  can  gain  competitive  advantage  by  pursuing  a  wider  
Purpose to make people’s lives better. The most effective brand purpose is authentically rooted 
in the DNA of the brand, its origins and heritage, not simply adopted to drive more sales. The acid 
test of a brand’s purpose is whether it is willing to forgo short-term profit to achieve that purpose. 
Warby  Parker’s  purpose  is  to  make  eyewear  more  affordable,  and  as  part  of  that  purpose,  has 
distributed 4 million pairs of glasses to those that otherwise could not afford them. For Natura & 
Co, the Brazilian personal care giant and owner of The Body Shop, sustainability is integral to the 
brand’s  existence.  In  2020,  the  company  announced  plans  to  further  protect  the  Amazon  
rainforest,  eliminate  its  greenhouse  gas  emissions  and  increase  economic  prosperity  for  local  
communities.  
 
EXECUTE THE BRAND PLAN 
The brand plan details how the brand strategy will be achieved. The plan may encompass different 
time frames, e.g., 3-year, budget year, or quarter. 
 
Broadly speaking, the plan will detail what marketing activities will be conducted over a specific 
time frame, when they will be executed, how much will be invested in each one, and what results 
are expected. If the brand is pursuing a sustainability agenda, then the brand plan will detail how 
the brand intends to support and publicize its activities.  
 
The scope of the brand plan will depend on the remit of marketing within the company, but every 
marketer aims to influence their potential customers in some way. Marketers enlist the help of 
specialist  outside  agencies  to  execute  specific  tasks,  e.g.,  media  agency,  creative  agency,  digital  
agency,  and  consumer  insight  firms.  With  the  complexity  of  today’s  media  and  retail  landscape  
the  overall  brand  plan  is  likely  broken  down  by  specialist  discipline,  e.g.,  digital,  search  engine  
optimization, in-house creative development. Other silos within the company may focus on other 
stakeholder  audiences,  e.g.,  publicity  and  investor  relations.  And  each  silo  will  need  to  interact 
with other disciplines within the overall company, e.g., R&D, finance, IT, key account management, 
production, and distribution, and its suppliers.  
 
IMPLEMENT A MARKETING CAMPAIGN 
A marketing campaign refers to a specific program within the plan designed to achieve a specific 
objective  and  usually  built  around  a  common  idea  or  theme.  Increasingly,  companies  are  
promoting their commitment to sustainability in specific ads, e.g., Apple created an ad featuring a 
baby  to  promote  its  commitment  to  being  100  percent  carbon  neutral  for  its  supply  chain  and  
products by 2030.  
 
There are two different tasks involved in executing an effective marketing campaign: 
1. Media delivery 
The marketer must get the campaign content (otherwise known as advertising) to where 
it has the potential to be seen or heard. The media channel is like a road. A media channel 
could be TikTok, a podcast, or good, old fashioned TV ads. The marketer needs to pick the 
right road to get to the destination, an attentive audience. The marketing content is the 

 
13 
vehicle that travels along the chosen road. Choosing the right media channels and investing 
enough in them to achieve the desired marketing objective is important, but it is the means 
to an end, not the end itself.  
 
2. Creative impact 
Once the content gets to its destination it must then earn people’s attention long enough 
to  deliver  the  intended  impression.  How  well  the  marketing  content  evokes  a  positive  
emotional  response  is  critical  to  gain  attention  and  ensure  the  advertising  impression  is  
remembered. Many studies have identified creative as the single most important driver of 
marketing effectiveness after category and brand size. The impact of creative is less to do 
with format, e.g., Instagram post, online video, or radio ad, and more to do with how well 
it  captures  people’s  attention. Typically,  content  that is  enjoyable,  interesting,  relevant, 
and distinctive is most effective.  
 
DEPLOY DIFFERENT TYPES OF MARKETING 
Marketing  as  practiced  today  is  a  hugely  complex  business,  involving  many  different  types  of  
marketing  activity  and  different  service  suppliers,  including  a  vast  array  of  companies  which  
support  the  technology  platforms  for  buying  and  delivering  advertising. Here  we  describe  two  
broad types of marketing activity and cover other, more specific formats in the glossary.  
 
1. Brand building 
Brand  building  is  any  marketing  activity  designed  to  build  demand  for  the  brand  by  
changing or strengthening people’s brand awareness and attitudes. Sustainability is most 
likely to be part of a brand building campaign. 
 
Brand building is often assumed to be the domain of traditional, broadcast advertising like 
TV, radio, billboards, print, and sports or event sponsorship. Brand building is also assumed 
to  work  over  the  long-term,  i.e.,  influencing  tomorrow’s  sales.  Both  assumptions  are  
incorrect, but commonplace.  There is absolutely no reason why digital marketing cannot 
help  build  a  brand,  if  it  is  used  with  that  intention,  and  if  advertising  does  not  generate 
sales  among  people  ready  to  buy  today,  it  is  unlikely  to  have  much  influence  on  future  
sales.  This  said,  brand  building  typically  involves  mass-market  advertising  designed  to  
encourage people to choose the brand when the time comes to buy.  
 
2. Brand activation 
Brand activation refers to a raft of marketing activities designed to create deeper, more 
personal  engagement  with  existing  or  potential  customers.  On  average,  these  activities  
account  for  most  of  the  marketing  budget.  Some  of  the  most  relevant  to  sustainability  
initiatives might include the following: 
 
a) Experiential marketing 
Experiential  marketing  includes  events  and  one-on-one  experiences,  such  as  a 
demonstration of product performance, delivering extra care to valued customers, and 
grassroots events. Several brands allow customers to trace back their specific purchase 
to the family or farm that grew a raw ingredient used in its manufacture.  
 
b) Influencer marketing 

 
14 
Influencer marketing involves paying or coopting people with large followings on social 
media to promote the brand and generate sales. The use of a well-known influencer 
like  Tara  McKenna  @zero.waste.collective  might  form  part  of  promoting  a  specific  
sustainability initiative.  
 
c) Content marketing 
This  involves  the  creation  and  placement  of  content,  often  purporting  to  be  articles,  
reviews, and think pieces, designed to highlight the brand’s advantages. Sustainability 
could well form part of a content marketing campaign.  
 
MEASURE THE RESULTS 
Marketers often find it difficult to quantify the results of their efforts, in large part because the 
success  of  any  marketing  campaign  is  integrally  bound  up  with  the  success  of  the  company’s  
products and business model. And even the most well-constructed marketing campaign may fail 
in the face of a more effective competitive campaign.  
 
The following will typically be used to measure progress: 
 
1. Sales and market share data 
Every company will have a measure of sales and market share that is used to track overall 
progress.  Data  may  be  limited  to  ex-factory  sales  or  shipments  but  more  often  the  
company will have access to some measure of competitive sales, e.g., audit of grocery store 
sales, audit of purchases from a panel of households, syndicated compilation of industry 
sales. 
 
2. Brand surveys 
A sample-based  measure  of  consumer  brand  awareness,  image,  and  purchase  intent.  
Conducted  periodically  or  run  continuously  over  time  to  better  examine  trends.  Often 
referred to as attitudinal data and generally considered inferior or diagnostic to behavioral 
data like sales. Questions may be included in studies to understand consumer awareness 
and  attitudes  of  the  brand’s  commitment  to  sustainability  or  specific  sustainability  
initiatives or campaigns. Surveys can also be run to understand the consumer response to 
a specific ad or ad campaign.  
 
3. Digital tracking 
Online  behavior  leaves  a  data  exhaust  that  can  be  mined  to  track brand  salience  and  
relevance (search share and trends), topics of interest (social media data mining), and track 
response to specific online content (clicks, dwell time, etc.). A brand could use this data to 
understand and track consumer interest in sustainability both generally, e.g., are buyers of 
its category more or less likely to talk about or search for topics related to sustainability, 
and  specifically,  e.g.,  did  the  new  ad  featuring  the  brand’s  commitment  to  regenerative  
agriculture generate a good number of views.  
 
4. Marketing analytics 
To try to isolate the influence of specific marketing activities on overall sales sophisticated 
statistical analysis may be used. Sales modeling, sometimes referred to as econometrics, 
will seek link variation in sales back to specific causal variables, e.g., distribution, pricing, 

 
15 
media  investment.  This  type  of  analysis  typically  only  identifies  the  short-term  influence  
on  sales.  A  more  sophisticated  approach  is  to  build  in  attitudinal  measures  from  brand  
tracking  and  identify  the  direct  and  indirect  effect  on  sales.  Sales  modeling  would  likely  
identify  the  short-term  sales  impact  from  any  sustainability  focused  ad  campaign  and  
changes  due  to  discrete  events,  e.g.,  a  change  in  ingredients  or  packaging.  More  
sophisticated analyses would identify whether awareness and perception of sustainability 
initiatives had any influence on purchase intent and sales.

WHERE DOES SUSTAINABILITY FIT WITH MARKETING? 
THE IMPORTANCE OF SUSTAINABILITY MIGHT BE WIDER THAN ASSUMED 
Given  that  most  consumers  are  focused  on  getting  a  good  price  rather  than  worry  about  
sustainability  credentials  it  can  be  easy  to  underestimate  sustainability’s  potential  importance.  
However, segmentation studies indicate that most consumers respond positively to sustainability. 
 
 
The challenge is to find the right way to catch people’s attention and deliver the right sustainability 
message. 
 
SUSTAINABILITY CAN FIT INTO THE BRAND PLAN 
As  you  will  have  gathered,  there  are  many  places  where  there  might  be  opportunities  for  
sustainability to become part of a brand’s marketing plan, from integral overall goal to a means to 
engage a specific target audience. But where might your initiative fit for your brand? 
 

 
17 
 
Part of the solution is to map out the ways in which your sustainability initiatives might dovetail 
with those of the marketing department. Do your own assessment. Ask yourself... 
• Is  there  an  obvious  and  growing  awareness  of  sustainability  issues  among  potential  
buyers? 
• How is your brand positioned against those trends? 
• Does your specific initiative offer the potential to build an existing competitive strength or 
remedy  a  weakness?  Does  it  offer  the  potential  to  generate  sales  by  making  the  brand  
seem more relevant to consumers? More likeable? More innovative? Different in a good 
way? 
• Even if it does not offer an immediate return today, is sustainability something that could 
bring  competitive  advantage  in  the  future?  Either  because  of  the  changing  cultural  
mindset,  or  because  it  offers  a  way  to  disrupt  the  current  status  quo  in  your  product  
category.  
 
 
 
The  big  challenge  is  making  sure  that  marketing  understands  how  sustainability  might  help  
improve brand sales now and in future. There is no doubt that it is becoming a more important 
issue for many, but how might your brand use it to gain competitive advantage today? And if it is 
not  a  major  issue  right  now,  how  might  your  brand  use  it  to  gain  competitive  advantage?  Your 
consumer insight team may already have data that shows how important sustainability issues are 
in  general  and  specifically  for  your  brand.  Get  hold  of  the  brand  plan  and  see  what  is  already  
planned. Are there obvious places that highlighting sustainability initiatives might help? 
 
Complete your assessment and then talk with the marketing team to see if there is any appetite 
for building your initiative into the marketing plan in some way. 
 
 

 
18 
IT IS ALWAYS GOOD TO TALK 
If you can, start at the top, because senior marketers will be most familiar with business trends 
and  issues,  and  are  less  likely  to  be  bogged  down  in  day-to-day  operations.  They  know  
sustainability  is  a  big  and  growing  issue  likely  to  affect  all  brands  and  will  be  looking  to  do  
something about it. However, it may be that younger members of the marketing team are more 
passionate about sustainability issues and will champion your cause within the team. 
 
Marketers are always on the lookout for a new way to promote their brand, improve its appeal, 
and drive sales. Like you, they may feel concerned about highlighting small scale initiatives that 
have yet to be widely adopted but the public will give credit for a company trying to do the right 
thing. Most  people  want  companies  to  do  the  right  thing  for  the  planet  and,  with  the  right  
communication, will reward a brand that can credibly claim to be making steps in that direction, 
even if they are small or not immediately relevant to the buyer.  
 
KEEP IT SIMPLE 
You  know  all  too  well  that  making  a  company  more  sustainable  is  fraught  with  challenges.  
However, simplicity sells. Before you make your pitch to marketing spend a little time to figure out 
how you can put your ideas across as simply as possible.

GLOSSARY OF ADDITIONAL MARKETING TERMINOLOGY 
Acquisition 
9  out  of  10  times  a  brand  grows  if  it  increases  its  penetration.  This  means  that  the  brand  must  
acquire enough new users to offset people who defect or fail to buy again during the specific time 
frame.  
 
Ad Impression 
Typically used in the context of media planning and evaluation, an impression when someone is 
exposed to an ad. (Given the complexities of digital media, viewable impressions are defined as 
those where the ad was visible to the user for a specific time frame.)  
 
Attitudinal Data 
Any form of consumer feedback involving questioning. This could be qualitative, usually involving 
small numbers of people, interviewed in-depth in the form of a guided discussion, or quantitative, 
usually  involving  a  predetermined  survey  asked  of  at  least  100  or  more  people  sampled  to  be  
representative of a larger group.  
 
Behavioral Data 
Direct  measurement  of  consumer  behavior,  including  store  sales,  consumer  panels  designed  to  
measure sales, and digital metrics like clicks.  
 
Brand Equity 
Marketers  often  refer  to  brand  equity  and  it  is  possibly  one  of  the  phrases  most  open  to  
interpretation! Brand equity may be used to refer to three basic ideas: 
1. The financial value vested in the intangible consumer value created by the brand. 
2. The consumer associations, expectations, and emotions that underpin that value. 
3. The measurement of those associations using surveys and social data.  
 
Brand And Product Portfolio 
A company may often own and market several brands in the same product category. The portfolio 
will  be  managed  and  marketed  to  maximize  sales.  Portfolios  might  address  specific  needs  or  
occasions, e.g., most automotive manufacturers will have a range of models designed for different 
needs, or price points, e.g., premium, mainstream, or value.  
 
Brand Extension 
A product designed to meet new needs, e.g., a “green” alternative to a standard product.  
 
Brand Image 
This  is  how  the  brand  is  perceived  by  the  end  consumer,  what  comes  to  mind  when  they  think  
about it. Often referred to as brand perceptions or associations and measured using survey data 
that asks how the brand compares to its competition, e.g., which of these brands are committed 
to being sustainable?  
 
 
 
 

 
20 
 
Brand Salience 
Brand  salience  refers  to  the  probability  that  a  buyer  will  notice,  recognize  and/or  think  of that 
brand in a buying situation. Another term for this is mental availability. 
 
Commerce Marketing 
Commerce  marketing  focuses  on  making  the  brand  easier  for  people  to  buy,  e.g.,  marketing  
activities for traditional retail, e-commerce, or direct-to-consumer. 
 
Communication Strategy 
A  subset  of  the  brand  strategy,  the  communication  strategy  details  the  theme  of  a  marketing  
campaign, the media channels and advertising formats to be used.  
 
Community Marketing 
Building active engagement with a group of enthused customers with the intention of generating 
positive buzz and word of mouth.  
 
Content Marketing 
Placement  of  content,  often  purporting  to  be  articles,  reviews,  and  think  pieces,  designed  to  
highlight the brand’s advantages.  
 
Convenience Metrics 
Often part of the digital data exhaust left by internet users, e.g., views and clicks.  
 
Creative Brief 
A document intended to give ad agency personnel all the information they need to develop the 
creative idea and related content.  
 
Creative Idea 
How the content is intended to highlight a specific aspect of the brand or its communication. So 
Snicker’s “You are not you when you are hungry” campaign depicts people acting out of character 
until they eat a Snickers.  
 
Creative Execution 
This is the incarnation of the creative idea, the final ad.  
 
Customer Experience 
The reaction of a buyer to using a product or service. Although most marketing attention is focused 
on the acquisition of new customers, service and retail companies recognize that a good customer 
experience  is  important  to  retaining  customers  over  time.  Quick  and  effective  response  to  
customer complaints is often an important driver of customer satisfaction.  
 
Distinctive Assets 
The unique identifiers by which people recognize a specific brand, e.g., Cornelius “Corny” Rooster 
for Kellogg’s Corn Flakes, along with the logo, font, and color scheme.  
 
 

 
21 
 
Experiential Marketing 
Experiential marketing includes events and one-on-one experiences, such as a demonstration of 
product performance, delivering extra care to valued customers, and grassroots events.  
 
Human Truth 
A creative idea will often be based on a human truth, a basic human motivation or reality, like the 
fact that people’s temperament often changes when they are hungry. The challenge is to make 
the truth specific to the brand, as Snickers did, and not just a generic idea.  
 
Influencer Marketing 
Paying people with large followings on social media to promote the brand and generate sales. 
 
Key Performance Indicators 
Specific  metrics  chosen  to  identify  a  brand’s  overall  progress  or  toward  specific  goals.  Could  be  
financial, commercial, or attitudinal. Used to identify areas requiring more management focus and 
investment and often reported in the form of online “dashboards” that seek to convey data quickly 
and easily.  
 
Market Share (Volume And Value) 
A commonly used measure of brand performance, market share represents the proportion of total 
category  sales  accounted  for  by  the  brand’s  sales.  There  are  two  basic  classifications  of  market  
share: volume and value. The first represents a share of units sold and the second is weighted by 
price. Importantly, the latter is predictive of profit and brand value.  
 
Media Context 
Generally, communications are more effective if the theme of the content is consistent with the 
theme of the editorial content in which it is placed.  
 
Paid, Owned, Earned, And Shared Media 
Marketers commonly differentiate between four different types of media channel: 
• Owned –  those under the brand’s direct control like its website, blog, or newsletter. 
• Shared –  social channels or user groups where the brand might either hope its content is 
shared or pay to advertise. 
• Earned –  unpaid publicity in the media (sometimes includes social media). 
• Paid –  any form of paid advertising, thought leadership, or sponsorship. 
 
Path To Purchase 
The process by which someone comes to buy a product or service, often focused on mindset and 
resources used to help decide brand choice.  
 
Penetration/Trial 
The  proportion  of  buyers  who  have  bought  the  brand  in  a  specific  time  frame,  e.g.,  the  brand  
achieved an annual penetration of 45%. Trial is similar, but usually derived from a survey.  
 
 
 

 
22 
 
Performance Marketing 
Performance marketing  uses  paid  marketing  channels,  like  Snapchat  and  Instagram,  Google  
search, and content creators like Taboola (originator of the “Recommended for you” ads at the 
end of many online articles), that allow the marketer to invest based on results, not just whether 
someone just sees the brand’s content. Ideally, the marketer only invests in the activities that are 
best able to drive sales, but this often defaults to using convenience metrics, like clicks, that are 
easily measured in real-time. A massive ecosystem of technology has grown up to facilitate buying, 
targeting, and delivering performance marketing. 
 
POS 
Point of sale refers to any in-store marketing activity. 
 
Price elasticity 
The degree to which sales increase or decrease in response to a rise or fall in prices. Price elasticity 
is a function of brand desirability, differentiation, and availability, and typically changes only slowly 
over time.  
 
Promotion Marketing 
Often  designed  to  add  perceived  value  to  the  brand,  promotion  marketing  includes  the  use  of  
competitions, gifts, and incentives to help boost sales. 
 
Reach & Frequency 
Marketers often talk of delivery in terms of reach & frequency. Reach is the total percent of the 
audience who have had the opportunity to see an ad or campaign at least once. Frequency is how 
often the content is seen on average within a specific time frame. 
 
Receptivity 
Generally,  communications  are  more  effective  if  people  are  in  the  right  frame  of  mind  for  the  
brand’s content to resonate with them when they encounter it. 
 
Relationship Marketing 
Sometimes  referred  to  as  database  marketing,  relationship  marketing  seeks  to  develop  a  more  
one-to-one  relationship  with  customers  using  tailored  products,  promotions,  and  
correspondence. 
 
Repeat Purchase/Retention 
Defined as the proportion of people who buy the brand more than once is a specific time frame. 
Repeat purchase is strongly related to penetration.  
 
SEO 
Search  engine  optimization  refers  to  the  manipulation  of  content,  wording,  tags,  and  more  to  
ensure a brand’s content appears as high up the search ranking as possible. 
 
Share of Voice 
The brand’s share of overall marketing expenditure in a defined product category.  
 

 
23 
 
SWOT 
Refers to strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats, and is often used as a basic way of 
identifying the right growth strategy for a brand. Given the growing importance of sustainability, 
it should be considered as part of the brand plan.  
 
Target Market 
A specific group of buyers defined by their behavior, needs, or attitudes. So potential buyers could 
be segmented into groups based on their attitudes to sustainability and brand might target those 
most committed to recycling.  
 
Touch Points 
Any  point  of  contact  between  a  consumer  and  the  brand,  including  seeing  it  used  by  others,  in  
advertising, in the media or using it.  
 
Trade Promotion or Sales Marketing 
More  closely  aligned  with  sales  or  key  account  management  than  marketing,  trade  promotion  
involves  the  creation  of  promotions  expressly  designed  to  generate  volume  sales  (these  largely  
benefit of the retailer but are a requirement to ensure a brand is listed and gets the shelf space it 
deserves). Price discounts are the crack cocaine of trade marketing and are funded by the brand 
not the retailer.",,2025-10-10 08:28:15.439226+00,2025-10-10 19:09:50.840516+00,f15f4a68-3268-452d-b4b0-e863f807db58,completed,f15f4a68-3268-452d-b4b0-e863f807db58/1760084895013-Guide-engaging-marketing-and-branding-teams.pdf,521264,"{""mime_type"":""application/pdf"",""uploaded_at"":""2025-10-10T08:28:15.389Z"",""original_filename"":""Guide-engaging-marketing-and-branding-teams.pdf""}",completed,26,,pdf,,,100,,2025-10-10 08:28:16.316+00,2025-10-10 08:28:18.726+00
e83f1705-34d0-4adc-a187-af02b4e5f34a,Shoestring AI SaaS MVP Marketing Guide Short V5,"The Guerrilla AI Launch: A Step-by-Step 
Playbook for Marketing Your SaaS MVP 
on a Shoestring 
 
 
Part I: The Pre-Launch Playbook: Architecting for Paid 
Success 
 
 
Chapter 1: The Paid-First MVP Mindset: From Minimum Viable to 
Minimum Valuable 
 
The conventional wisdom surrounding the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) often conjures 
images of duct tape, buggy interfaces, and a desperate plea for user feedback. This 
approach, born from the ""move fast and break things"" ethos, is fundamentally misaligned with 
the goal of launching a product that commands a price from day one. For the shoestring AI 
SaaS founder, the MVP cannot be a prototype; it must be a polished, reliable, and complete 
solution to a very specific, high-value problem. This chapter reframes the MVP concept, 
shifting the focus from minimum viable to minimum valuable, and establishes the foundational 
mindset required to justify a price tag from the moment of inception. 
 
Redefining the MVP for a Paid World 
 
An MVP intended for a paid launch is not the first 10% of a sprawling product roadmap. It is 
not a sketch, a wireframe, or a half-built application. It is, unequivocally, a product.
1
 Every 
version of this MVP, even the very first, must be usable, testable, and valuable in its own right. 
It must stand on its own as a functional solution with room to grow, not as a compromised 
version of a future promise.
1
 The core purpose of this refined MVP is to solve one specific 
problem with an exceptional degree of precision and reliability.
2
 This lean approach is not 

about shipping less; it's about focusing on the absolute essentials that drive tangible value for 
the user.
1 
To achieve this level of focus, a rigorous prioritization process is non-negotiable. The goal is 
to identify the bare minimum functionality required to test the product's core viability, not to 
build a comprehensive suite of features.
4
 Many companies make the critical error of stuffing 
their MVP with non-essential or overly complex features, forgetting that it is not the 
end-product.
1
 The objective is to collect the maximum amount of validated learning about 
customers with the least effort, and for a paid product, the most crucial piece of validated 
learning is their willingness to open their wallets.
5 
The prioritization process should filter every potential feature through a series of critical 
questions 
4
: 
1. 
Can the product function without this feature? If the core value proposition collapses 
without it, it's essential. If it's an enhancement, it can wait. 
2. 
Does the target audience explicitly want this feature? This must be based on direct 
research and interviews, not assumptions. 
3. 
Does this feature solve a critical, high-pain problem? The MVP must target a 
""hair-on-fire"" problem, not a minor inconvenience. 
4. 
Will this feature have a significant impact on revenue? For a paid MVP, features that 
directly enable or justify the price are paramount. 
5. 
Is this feature a non-negotiable part of the core product vision? 
For instance, an MVP for a healthcare SaaS platform might require document management, 
client management, and robust security to ensure regulatory compliance. These are 
must-haves. Features like time-tracking or marketing extensions, while useful, would be 
postponed for future iterations.
4
 This disciplined approach ensures that development 
resources are channeled exclusively into the features that deliver immediate, demonstrable 
value, forming the foundation of a product that people will pay for.
6 
 
The Psychology of ""Early Access"" vs. ""Beta Testing"" 
 
Language is not a trivial detail; it is a powerful tool that shapes perception and sets 
expectations. The way an early product is framed can mean the difference between being 
perceived as a premium, exclusive opportunity and a buggy, unfinished project seeking free 
labor. 
The term ""beta test"" inherently implies incompleteness. It signals to the user that the product 
is likely to have bugs, that features are missing, and that their primary role is to act as an 

unpaid quality assurance tester. This framing benefits the founder by offloading the testing 
burden, but it simultaneously devalues the product in the user's mind. When a user is asked to 
""test"" something, the implicit contract is that their time and feedback are the currency of 
exchange, not their money. 
Conversely, positioning the launch as an ""Early Access Program"" or a ""Pilot Program"" 
completely reframes the dynamic.
7
 This language suggests exclusivity and privilege. It 
positions early adopters not as testers, but as founding members or valued partners who are 
being granted a special opportunity. They are insiders, given the chance to shape the future 
of a promising new tool before it becomes widely available.
2
 This psychological shift is critical 
for a paid launch. It creates a compelling reason to join that goes beyond mere curiosity; it 
taps into the desire for status, influence, and access to innovation.
8 
This positioning must be reinforced with tangible benefits that reward the early adopter's 
commitment. These are not just users; they are the first believers, and they should be treated 
as such. Perks can include: 
● 
Exclusive Pricing: Offering significant lifetime discounts or special founding member 
rates acknowledges their early support and locks in their loyalty.
8 
● 
Direct Access: Providing a direct line to the founding team, such as a private Slack 
channel or exclusive Q&A sessions, makes them feel heard and valued.
8 
● 
Influence on the Roadmap: Giving early adopters a genuine say in feature prioritization 
and product direction transforms them from passive users into active co-creators.
8 
By carefully managing this narrative, the founder shifts the conversation from ""Please help me 
test my app for free"" to ""I'm offering you a unique opportunity to be part of something new 
and valuable."" This is the foundational positioning required to ask for payment with 
confidence. 
 
Validating the Problem and the Price Point Simultaneously 
 
A common pitfall for founders is to treat problem validation and pricing as two separate, 
sequential steps. They first confirm that a problem exists and then, much later, try to attach a 
price to their solution. This is a flawed approach. For a paid MVP, the central business 
hypothesis is not merely ""Does this solve a problem?"" but ""Does this solve a problem that 
people will pay to have solved?"".
1
 Therefore, these two validation streams must be concurrent 
from the very first interaction with a potential customer. 
The validation process begins long before a single line of code is written. It starts with 
conversations. The initial goal is to conduct 10-15 casual, exploratory interviews with 

individuals who fit the ideal customer profile.
2
 The purpose of these conversations is not to 
pitch a solution but to deeply understand the problem space. However, it's crucial to go 
beyond simply identifying pain points. A user might describe a problem as severe, but if their 
current workaround is free and ""good enough,"" their willingness to pay for a new solution will 
be minimal. 
To bridge this gap, the validation interviews must be designed to uncover the economic and 
emotional cost of the problem. The questioning framework should evolve: 
● 
From: ""Is [problem X] a challenge for you?"" 
● 
To: ""Tell me about the last time you dealt with [problem X]. What was that process like?"" 
● 
From: ""Would a tool that does be useful?"" 
● 
To: ""What have you tried in the past to solve [problem X]? What did you like or dislike 
about those solutions?"" 
● 
And most critically: ""What have you spent—in terms of time, money, or other 
resources—trying to manage this problem?"" and ""If you could wave a magic wand and 
make this problem disappear, what would that be worth to you on a monthly basis?"".
10 
The answers to these latter questions are gold. They provide a direct anchor for the product's 
value. If a potential customer reveals they waste 10 hours a month on a task and their time is 
worth $100 an hour, a $1,000 problem has been identified. This creates a powerful 
foundation for a value-based pricing discussion. 
After confirming the problem's existence and its perceived cost, the next step is to test the 
proposed solution. This does not require a working product. A simple landing page, a slide 
deck, or even a hand-drawn sketch of the user interface can be presented to a different set of 
5-10 potential users.
2
 The pitch is simple: ""We are building a tool to solve [problem X]. This is 
how it will work. Based on what you see, is this something you would be willing to pay for?"" 
This creates a ""Value-Validation Loop."" The insights from the problem-cost interviews directly 
inform the pricing strategy (e.g., Pilot Pricing or Value-Based Pricing), which is then tested 
with the solution mockups.
7
 This iterative process ensures that by the time the MVP is ready 
for launch, the price is not an arbitrary number pulled from thin air but a figure that is already 
validated and anchored to the customer's own perception of the problem's cost. This makes 
the eventual sales conversation feel logical and fair, dramatically increasing the likelihood of 
converting those first crucial paying customers. 
 
Chapter 2: Crafting a High-Resonance Value Proposition for AI 
 
In the crowded SaaS marketplace, a compelling value proposition is the hook that captures 
attention and differentiates a product from a sea of ""me too"" solutions.
11
 For an AI-based 

SaaS, this challenge is amplified. The term ""AI"" itself is both a powerful buzzword and a 
source of confusion, skepticism, and fear. A successful value proposition must therefore not 
only communicate the product's core benefit but also translate the complexity of AI into 
tangible, desirable outcomes for a diverse audience. This chapter provides a tactical 
framework for building a message that resonates with everyone from deep-learning engineers 
to privacy-conscious small business owners. 
 
The Anatomy of a SaaS Value Proposition 
 
A strong SaaS value proposition is a concise, powerful statement that answers the 
fundamental question in a potential customer's mind: ""Why should I buy your software?"".
11
 It is 
the foundation of the product's story and should serve as the north star for all marketing 
efforts.
12
 While the exact wording will evolve, a winning value proposition is built on a simple, 
proven structure comprising three essential elements 
13
: 
1. 
The Headline: This is the first point of contact. In a single, punchy sentence, it must 
articulate the primary end-benefit for the customer. It should be specific, credible, and 
attention-grabbing. Successful headlines often name the audience (""for global teams"") 
or quantify a result (""used by 10,000+ designers"") to build immediate trust.
13
 Examples 
like Slack's ""Slack is where work happens"" or Shopify's ""The platform commerce is built 
on"" are masterful because they are short, memorable, and focus on a high-level 
outcome.
11 
2. 
The Sub-headline (or Short Paragraph): This element adds clarity and context. It 
should briefly explain what the product is, who it is for, and the key benefit it delivers. The 
crucial mistake to avoid here is listing features. Customers do not buy features; they buy 
better versions of themselves. The copy must translate technical capabilities into 
real-world benefits.
11
 For example, instead of stating, ""Our software integrates with over 
50 platforms,"" a benefit-focused approach would be, ""Streamline your workflow by 
connecting all your tools in one place"".
11
 The goal is to ditch the tech talk and make it 
crystal clear how the product will improve the customer's daily life.
11 
3. 
The Visual Element: A hero image, a short video, or an animated GIF should visually 
reinforce the message of the headline and sub-headline. It should show the product in 
action, delivering the promised benefit. A common mistake is using a visual that 
introduces unrelated features or distracting animations, which pulls attention away from 
the core message.
13
 The visual and the text must work in harmony to tell a single, 
coherent story. 
The ultimate test of a value proposition is its clarity and conciseness. A single sentence that 
packs a punch is far more effective than a paragraph of fluff.
11
 It must be clear enough for 
both humans and machines to understand, especially in an era of AI-generated product 

summaries.
13 
 
The AI Translation Layer: Messaging for a Mixed Audience 
 
An AI SaaS product rarely has a monolithic audience. The user base for this MVP is a prime 
example, spanning from highly technical AI enthusiasts to non-technical business owners. A 
one-size-fits-all message is doomed to fail. To succeed, marketing communications must 
employ a ""Translation Layer,"" a strategic approach that adapts the core value proposition to 
the specific language, priorities, and pain points of each audience segment.
14 
● 
For AI Enthusiasts and Developers: This audience is technically fluent and deeply 
skeptical of marketing hype. The messaging for them can and should be more technical. 
They want to understand the ""how"" behind the ""what."" 
○ 
Focus: Emphasize the unique technical architecture, the specific AI models being 
used (e.g., fine-tuned Llama 3, a proprietary model), API quality, and any novel 
approaches to data processing or model training.
15 
○ 
Language: Use their language. Terms like ""vector database,"" ""low-latency inference,"" 
and ""fine-tuning"" are not jargon here; they are signals of credibility.
16
 Show, don't just 
tell. Provide code snippets, links to technical documentation, and performance 
benchmarks.
17 
○ 
Example Value Prop: ""Build and deploy private, fine-tuned LLMs with our serverless 
inference API. Zero config, pay-per-token, and 90% lower latency than self-hosting."" 
● 
For Corporate AI Implementers and IT Managers: This audience acts as a bridge 
between the technical and business worlds. Their primary concerns are ROI, security, 
scalability, and seamless integration with existing tech stacks. They are under pressure to 
make sound technology decisions that benefit the entire organization.
18 
○ 
Focus: The message must be centered on business outcomes. How does this AI tool 
reduce costs, increase efficiency, mitigate risk, or generate revenue?.
19
 Security, 
compliance (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA), and integration capabilities are non-negotiable 
points to address.
4 
○ 
Language: Use business and financial terminology. Frame benefits in terms of hitting 
KPIs, improving team productivity, and achieving strategic goals.
19
 Social proof, such 
as logos of other companies using the product or case studies with measurable 
results, is extremely persuasive.
22 
○ 
Example Value Prop: ""The AI-powered compliance platform for enterprise teams. 
Automate SOC 2 evidence collection, reduce audit prep time by 80%, and ensure 
continuous security monitoring without draining IT resources."" 
● 
For Non-Technical Business Owners: This audience is the least interested in the 
underlying technology and the most focused on the ultimate outcome. The AI is a black 

box to them; they only care about what comes out of it. The messaging must be 
ruthlessly simple, tangible, and jargon-free. 
○ 
Focus: Frame the AI in a way that is instantly relatable. The concept of ""AI 
employees"" used by the work management platform Motion is brilliant because it 
reframes software as a digital workforce that can delegate tasks and scale capacity 
without new hires.
13
 The benefit should be immediate and clear, such as 
""Autonomous AI for billing, contracts, and collections"".
23 
○ 
Language: Use analogies, everyday metaphors, and storytelling to explain complex 
ideas.
14
 Focus on emotional benefits: peace of mind, more free time, less frustration. 
The goal is to make them feel understood and empowered, not intimidated by 
technology.
16 
○ 
Example Value Prop: ""Your private AI business coach. Get expert advice on 
marketing, sales, and operations, trained on your own business data, without sharing 
anything with third parties."" 
 
Addressing AI-Specific Concerns: Privacy and Ethics 
 
For certain audience segments, particularly local business owners or those in regulated 
industries, the promise of AI is overshadowed by legitimate concerns about data privacy, 
security, and ethical use. For these groups, addressing these fears is not an afterthought—it is 
a core component of the value proposition and a powerful competitive differentiator.
24 
Building a privacy-first marketing culture is essential.
26
 This means moving beyond boilerplate 
legal disclaimers and integrating transparency into the very fabric of the product's messaging. 
A proactive approach to privacy builds trust, which is the foundation of customer loyalty.
25 
Key messaging points to include are: 
● 
Transparent Data Handling: Clearly and simply communicate what data is collected, 
why it is needed, and how it will be used. Avoid complex legal terms.
24 
● 
User Control: Emphasize that the user is in control. This includes providing clear options 
to opt out of data collection for personalization and easy ways for users to access and 
manage their data.
24 
● 
Data Minimization: Communicate a commitment to collecting only the data that is 
absolutely essential to provide the service. This demonstrates respect for user privacy 
and reduces liability.
25 
● 
Commitment to Ethical AI: If applicable, explain the steps taken to mitigate bias in AI 
models and ensure fairness. This positions the brand as a trusted and responsible 
partner.
28 

By weaving these elements directly into the value proposition and marketing materials, an AI 
SaaS can turn a potential objection into a compelling reason to choose its solution over less 
transparent competitors. For a privacy-conscious buyer, a clear and honest privacy policy is a 
more valuable feature than a dozen minor functionalities. 
 
Chapter 3: Strategic Pricing and Positioning for Early Adopters 
 
Pricing an MVP is a delicate balancing act. On one hand, the product has a limited feature set, 
which might suggest a lower price. On the other hand, early adopters are taking a higher risk 
and providing invaluable feedback, which suggests they deserve a premium for their support.
7
 
Furthermore, price is a powerful signal of quality and value; pricing too low can permanently 
anchor the product in the ""cheap"" category, making it difficult to raise prices later.
7
 This 
chapter outlines strategies to price an MVP in a way that reinforces its value, attracts the right 
kind of early customer, and establishes a solid foundation for future revenue growth. 
 
Choosing Your MVP Pricing Model 
 
There is no one-size-fits-all pricing model for an MVP. The right strategy depends on the 
product, the target market, and the primary business objective—whether it's maximizing early 
revenue or accelerating adoption.
7
 For a paid-first MVP on a shoestring budget, models that 
generate immediate revenue and validation are generally preferable. Here are five effective 
strategies, with a focus on those best suited for a B2B context 
7
: 
1. 
Pilot Pricing: This is arguably the strongest model for a new B2B SaaS MVP. It involves 
offering a substantial discount, typically 30-50% below the intended future market rate, 
to a handpicked group of early customers. The key to this strategy is the explicit 
agreement: in exchange for the special pricing, these customers commit to providing 
regular, structured feedback and serving as future reference customers or testimonials. 
This model brilliantly reframes the relationship. The customers are not beta testers; they 
are members of an exclusive pilot program, treated as valued partners whose insights are 
crucial to the product's development.
7
 This approach secures early revenue, gathers 
critical product feedback, and generates the social proof (case studies, testimonials) 
needed to accelerate future sales. 
2. 
Value-Based Pricing: This strategy is best suited for products that deliver a clear, 
measurable Return on Investment (ROI) or cost savings. Instead of basing the price on 
development costs or competitor pricing, it is anchored to the economic value the 

solution provides to the customer. The price is set as a percentage of the value 
created—for example, a procurement optimization tool might charge 20% of the 
documented savings it generates for a client.
7
 For an MVP, this can be a powerful way to 
justify the price, as it directly aligns the product's cost with its success. It requires deep 
customer research to quantify the value, but when the ROI is clear, it allows for premium 
pricing even with a limited feature set. 
3. 
Incremental Value Pricing: This model is ideal for products with a clear and transparent 
public roadmap. The initial price is set low to reflect the MVP's limited feature set, 
rewarding early adopters for their faith in the product's vision. However, the company 
communicates transparently that the price will increase as new features and capabilities 
are added. According to research from ProfitWell, companies that implement this 
strategy see an average revenue increase of 22% during their early evolution phases.
7
 
This approach builds loyalty by making early customers feel smart for getting in on the 
ground floor, while setting a clear expectation of rising value and price over time. 
4. 
Free With a Clear Conversion Path: This strategy involves offering a core set of 
features for free, with more advanced functionality, higher usage limits, or premium 
support reserved for paying customers. Slack is a classic example, offering a generous 
free tier with a clear upgrade path once a team's needs grow.
7
 This model can be 
effective for products that benefit from network effects or require mass adoption to 
demonstrate their full value. However, for a bootstrapped MVP, it carries the risk of 
attracting a large number of free users who never convert, straining resources without 
providing revenue validation. If this path is chosen, the conversion path must be 
exceptionally clear and compelling. 
5. 
Freemium-to-Premium Migration: This is a longer-term strategy that involves offering 
the initial version of the product completely free to maximize user acquisition and build a 
large user base. Monetization is introduced only after achieving significant usage metrics 
and establishing strong product-market fit. Evernote famously used this model for years.
7
 
While powerful for venture-backed startups focused on rapid growth, this approach is 
generally not recommended for a shoestring MVP that needs to validate its business 
model and generate revenue early on. 
 
The ""Early Adopter"" Landing Page 
 
The pre-launch landing page is more than just a tool for collecting email addresses; it is a 
critical positioning asset that sets the tone for the entire launch. A poorly framed landing 
page can inadvertently position the product as a free beta, while a well-crafted one can build 
a queue of eager, high-quality potential customers. 
The language used is paramount. The call to action should not be ""Sign up for our beta."" 
Instead, it should be ""Apply for the Pilot Program,"" ""Request Early Access,"" or ""Join the 

Founding Members."" This subtle shift in wording transforms the proposition from a request for 
help into an offer of exclusivity.
8 
A strategic waitlist does more than just validate demand; it helps refine the product and build 
momentum. The key is to attract users who genuinely need the solution, not just a massive list 
of passive, curious onlookers.
8
 To achieve this, the landing page should offer compelling 
reasons to join, such as 
8
: 
● 
Exclusive Community Access: Granting waitlist members access to a private Discord or 
Slack community where they can interact directly with the founding team. 
● 
Special Pricing or Perks: Offering lifetime discounts or free access to future premium 
features. 
● 
Recognition and Influence: Highlighting the opportunity for early adopters to shape the 
product's future and see their feedback implemented. 
By curating the waitlist in this way, the founder is not just building an email list; they are 
building the foundation of a loyal community and identifying the power users who will become 
the product's first evangelists.
8 
 
Communicating Value to Justify the Cost 
 
Once a pricing model is chosen, it must be supported by consistent and compelling 
messaging across all marketing materials. The price is a direct reflection of the product's 
perceived value, and every touchpoint must work to reinforce that value. 
The core principle is to focus on the outcome, not the technology.
1
 The value proposition 
crafted in the previous chapter must be front and center on the website, in email outreach, 
and in ad copy.
3
 This ensures that potential customers are constantly reminded of the problem 
being solved and the tangible benefits they will receive. 
While it's important to benchmark against competitors to understand the market landscape, 
pricing should not be solely dictated by what others are charging.
7
 An MVP with a unique 
value proposition can and should command a price that reflects that uniqueness. Price serves 
as an indicator of quality, especially for new products with limited market presence.
7
 A price 
that feels too low can signal a lack of confidence or a subpar product, undermining the 
premium positioning. 
Ultimately, pricing an MVP is an integral part of the product development process itself. It is 
not a ""set it and forget it"" decision. It should be tested, refined, and evolved based on market 
feedback and business objectives.
7
 By starting with a strategic model, positioning the offer as 

exclusive, and consistently communicating value, a founder can confidently charge for their 
MVP from day one, turning their first users into paying customers who are invested in the 
product's long-term success. 
 
Part II: The Organic Engine: Building Authority and 
Community from Day Zero 
 
 
Chapter 4: Content as a Trojan Horse: Establishing Technical Authority 
 
For an AI SaaS startup, especially one targeting developers and technically-savvy 
professionals, content is not merely a marketing tactic; it is the primary vehicle for 
demonstrating credibility. Technical buyers are inherently risk-averse and possess a 
deep-seated skepticism towards marketing fluff.
15
 They cannot be persuaded with clever 
taglines alone. They must be convinced through a clear, consistent demonstration of 
expertise. This chapter outlines a content strategy designed to function as a Trojan Horse: 
delivering immense value and establishing technical authority, thereby earning the trust and 
attention of a discerning audience long before a sales pitch is ever made. 
 
Mapping Content to the AI Buyer Journey 
 
A successful content strategy for a technical audience must be meticulously mapped to their 
decision-making process. These buyers undertake a journey of education and validation, and 
the content must meet them at each stage with the right information and the right format.
15 
● 
Awareness Stage: Teaching the Basics and Framing the Problem
 
At this stage, potential users are identifying a challenge or exploring a new technology, 
but they are not yet evaluating specific solutions. The content goal is to educate, 
generate interest, and build foundational trust.15 The content should establish the brand 
as a knowledgeable guide in the AI space. 
○ 
Content Types: 
■ 
Blog Series: A series of articles that explain core AI concepts within a business 
context. For example, ""A Practical Guide to Retrieval-Augmented Generation 
(RAG) for Customer Support"" or ""Understanding AI Hallucinations and How to 

Mitigate Them"".
15 
■ 
How-To Guides: Comprehensive guides that address fundamental decisions, 
such as the pros and cons of building an AI solution in-house versus buying a 
SaaS product.
15 
■ 
Webinars with Experts: Hosting or participating in webinars with recognized 
industry experts or academics can lend credibility and attract a wider audience.
15 
■ 
Interactive Glossaries: Simple tools like an interactive glossary of AI terms can 
serve as a valuable, shareable resource that drives organic traffic.
15 
● 
Consideration Stage: Demonstrating the Solution's Efficacy
 
Once a user is actively researching solutions, the content must shift to demonstrating the 
product's specific capabilities and proving its reliability. This is where deep technical 
details and social proof become paramount. 
○ 
Content Types: 
■ 
Detailed Case Studies: These are critical. They must go beyond surface-level 
success stories and detail the entire journey: the initial problem, the 
implementation process, the technical challenges overcome, and the measurable 
results. The case study should include technical specifics for the engineers and 
quantifiable business impact for the executives.
15 
■ 
Comparison Guides: Honest, in-depth comparisons of the product against 
direct competitors or alternative approaches (e.g., open-source libraries). 
Highlighting weaknesses of competitors is a powerful way to position the 
product's strengths.
15 
■ 
Technical Whitepapers: Deep dives into the technology behind the product. 
Topics could include the specifics of the model optimizers used, the approach to 
data backpropagation, or a detailed analysis of the RAG pipeline's performance.
15 
● 
Decision Stage: Removing Final Barriers to Adoption
 
At the final stage, the user is close to making a purchase decision. The content must 
provide all the necessary information to remove any final friction and make the adoption 
process as smooth as possible. 
○ 
Content Types: 
■ 
Comprehensive Technical Documentation: This is a marketing asset, not just a 
support document. Clear, well-structured API documentation with code samples 
is essential for any developer-focused product.
15 
■ 
ROI and Pricing Calculators: Interactive tools that allow a potential customer to 
estimate their potential return on investment or understand cost factors provide 
transparency and help them build a business case internally.
15 
■ 
Implementation and Planning Guides: Detailed roadmaps that walk a user 
through the onboarding and implementation process, addressing common 
challenges and setting expectations for success.
15 
 

Choosing the Right Content Formats for a Technical Audience 
 
The medium is as important as the message. A technical audience consumes information in 
specific ways, and the content strategy must cater to these preferences to be effective.
32 
● 
Long-Form Blog Posts & Whitepapers: These are the cornerstones of an 
authority-building content strategy. They provide the space needed for in-depth analysis, 
showcasing true expertise and performing well in search engine rankings for niche 
topics.
15 
● 
Technical Tutorials & How-To Guides: This is arguably the most critical format for 
developers and engineers. They provide hands-on, step-by-step instructions that allow 
users to learn by doing. These guides should be rich with code snippets, screenshots, 
and practical examples, enabling users to apply their knowledge immediately.
15 
● 
API Documentation: For any SaaS with an API, the documentation is a product in itself. It 
must be meticulously maintained, easy to navigate, and comprehensive. Developers will 
judge the quality of the entire product based on the quality of its documentation.
15 
● 
Webinars and Virtual Summits: These formats offer a dynamic way to engage the 
audience, allowing for real-time Q&A sessions and deeper dives into complex topics. 
They also provide an opportunity to feature guest experts, further boosting credibility.
15 
● 
Short-Form Video & Infographics: While technical audiences appreciate depth, visual 
formats are powerful for simplifying complex concepts and distributing key insights. A 
short video tutorial demonstrating a key feature or an infographic explaining a system 
architecture can be highly effective for sharing on social platforms like LinkedIn or 
Twitter.
15 
● 
Case Studies and Testimonials: While often text-based, these are a distinct format 
focused on user-generated content. They provide the social proof that is essential for 
building trust, highlighting how real customers have solved real problems with the 
product.
30 
 
Writing for Developers: Clarity, Accuracy, and No Fluff 
 
When creating content for a technical audience, the writing style must be adapted to their 
expectations. This audience values efficiency, precision, and authenticity above all else. 
● 
Clarity and Conciseness: Use clear, direct language. Write in an active voice with short 
sentences. While it's important to avoid unnecessary jargon that could alienate parts of 
the audience, using industry-specific terminology correctly is crucial for establishing 
credibility.
32
 A glossary of terms can be a helpful resource to maintain consistency and 
assist less technical readers.
32 

● 
Logical Structure: Content must be logically organized and easy to navigate. Use clear 
headings, subheadings, bullet points, and numbered lists to break down complex 
information into digestible chunks. A well-structured article allows a busy developer to 
quickly scan and find the exact information they need.
32 
● 
Authoritative Tone: The tone should be serious, confident, and helpful. The goal is to 
position the brand as an expert guide, efficiently leading the reader from a problem to a 
solution.
35
 Humor can be used sparingly, but only if it feels authentic and doesn't detract 
from the technical substance.
16 
● 
Accuracy is Paramount: Every technical claim, code sample, and data point must be 
rigorously fact-checked. A single inaccurate piece of information can destroy credibility. 
Incorporate a technical review stage into the editorial workflow, where subject-matter 
experts verify all content before publication.
32 
● 
Embrace Authenticity: Avoid marketing speak and corporate buzzwords like 
""innovative,"" ""robust,"" and ""cutting-edge"".
16
 This language is an instant turn-off for a 
skeptical technical audience. Instead, write as you would speak to a knowledgeable 
colleague. Sharing personal experiences, including challenges and failures, can add a 
genuine, human feel to the copy and build a stronger connection with the reader.
16 
By adhering to these principles, an AI SaaS startup can create a content engine that not only 
drives traffic but also builds a reputation for technical excellence—the most valuable currency 
when selling to developers. 
 
Chapter 5: The Long-Tail SEO Gambit: Winning Niche Search without a 
Budget 
 
For a new AI SaaS MVP operating on a shoestring budget, competing for broad, high-volume 
keywords like ""AI software"" is a futile and expensive endeavor. The search engine results 
pages (SERPs) for these terms are dominated by established industry giants with massive 
marketing budgets and years of accumulated domain authority.
39
 The only viable path to 
gaining a foothold in organic search is to sidestep this competition entirely. This is achieved 
through the Long-Tail SEO Gambit: a disciplined strategy focused on targeting highly specific, 
multi-word search queries that, while low in individual search volume, signal strong user intent 
and face significantly less competition. This chapter provides a step-by-step guide to finding, 
targeting, and ranking for the niche keywords that will drive qualified, high-converting traffic 
to an MVP. 
 
The Philosophy of Long-Tail Keywords for B2B SaaS 

 
Long-tail keywords are the unsung heroes of B2B marketing.
41
 These are longer, more 
conversational search phrases that users type when they have a very specific problem or are 
further along in their buying journey.
40
 A user searching for ""AI"" is browsing; a user searching 
for ""secure on-premise AI model for healthcare data analysis"" is looking to buy. 
The strategic advantages of focusing on long-tail keywords are manifold: 
● 
Lower Competition: Because these terms are so specific, fewer websites are actively 
trying to rank for them. This makes it significantly easier for a new website with low 
domain authority to achieve a high ranking on the first page of Google.
40 
● 
Higher Conversion Rates: The specificity of a long-tail query indicates a higher level of 
user intent. These users are not just looking for information; they are looking for a 
solution. Traffic from these keywords is more qualified and converts at a much higher rate 
than traffic from broad terms.
40 
● 
Attracting a Niche Audience: For a B2B SaaS product, attracting a niche audience is 
not a limitation; it is the entire goal. Long-tail keywords act as a magnet for the exact 
businesses and professionals who are looking for the specific solution the MVP offers, 
leading to higher-quality leads with greater lifetime value.
40 
● 
Cost-Effectiveness: From a paid advertising perspective, long-tail keywords have a 
much lower cost-per-click (CPC) due to the reduced competition, making them a smart 
choice for a limited budget.
40 
For an AI SaaS MVP, this strategy is not just an option; it is a necessity. The focus must shift 
entirely from chasing high search volume to precisely matching search intent.
44
 It is better to 
be the number one result for a keyword searched by 10 ideal customers per month than to be 
on page ten for a keyword searched by 10,000 unqualified users. 
 
Step-by-Step Niche Keyword Research Process 
 
Finding the right long-tail keywords requires a combination of creative brainstorming and 
data-driven analysis. The goal is to uncover the exact language the target audience uses 
when they are trying to solve the problem the MVP addresses. 
1. 
Brainstorm Seed Topics and Keyword Modifiers: Start by listing the core problems the 
product solves and its main features. Then, brainstorm ""modifier"" words that a B2B buyer 
would use. These often relate to industry, use case, price, or alternatives.
43 
○ 
Seed Topic: ""private AI model"" 
○ 
Industry Modifiers: for healthcare, for finance, for legal 
○ 
Use Case Modifiers: for document analysis, for customer support, for code 

generation 
○ 
Commercial Modifiers: software, tool, platform, alternative, pricing, vs 
○ 
Audience Modifiers: for small business, for enterprise teams, for developers 
2. 
Utilize Free and Freemium Research Tools: With these seed topics and modifiers, 
begin exploring keyword variations. 
○ 
Google Search: Type a query into Google and analyze the ""People Also Ask"" boxes 
and the ""Related searches"" at the bottom of the page. These are direct insights into 
what real users are searching for in relation to the topic.
42
 Google's autocomplete 
predictions as one types are another valuable source of ideas.
42 
○ 
Keyword Research Tools: While advanced tools like Ahrefs and Semrush have paid 
tiers, their free or freemium versions can still provide a wealth of information. Use 
them to explore keyword variations, see estimated search volumes, and, most 
importantly, analyze the Keyword Difficulty (KD) score, which measures how hard it is 
to rank in the top 10.
42 
○ 
AI Chatbots: Tools like ChatGPT can be used as brainstorming partners. A prompt 
like, ""I have an AI SaaS product that helps small law firms analyze case documents 
privately. What are some long-tail keywords a paralegal or lawyer might search for 
when looking for a solution like this?"" can generate a useful starting list.
42 
3. 
Mine Online Communities for ""Voice of Customer"" Data: The most valuable keywords 
are often not found in a tool but in the authentic conversations of the target audience. 
○ 
Niche Subreddits: Go to subreddits like r/law, r/sysadmin, r/MachineLearning, or 
industry-specific forums. Search for terms related to the problem space and pay 
close attention to the exact phrasing people use in their questions and complaints. 
This is ""voice of customer"" data in its purest form.
42 
○ 
Q&A Sites: Explore sites like Quora and Stack Overflow for similar insights. 
4. 
Interview Early Users and Prospects: The most direct way to find relevant keywords is 
to ask the target audience. Drawing from the ""5 questions"" framework, ask early users 
and prospects questions like 
43
: 
○ 
""When you first realized you needed a solution for [problem], what were the first 
things you typed into Google?"" 
○ 
""Before you found us, what other tools or solutions were you looking at?"" 
5. 
Filter and Prioritize: After gathering a large list of potential keywords, filter it down 
based on two primary criteria: 
○ 
High Intent: Prioritize keywords with clear commercial or transactional intent. These 
often include words like ""software,"" ""tool,"" ""platform,"" ""alternative,"" ""comparison,"" or 
are phrased as a direct question about solving a business problem.
44 
○ 
Low Competition: Focus on keywords with a low Keyword Difficulty (KD) score, 
ideally below 30 in tools like Ahrefs or Semrush.
42
 This indicates a higher probability 
of ranking with a new website. 
 

Building Topical Authority with Content Clusters 
 
Ranking for individual long-tail keywords is only part of the battle. To be recognized by search 
engines like Google as a true authority on a subject, a website must demonstrate 
comprehensive expertise. This is achieved by organizing content into ""topic clusters"" using a 
hub-and-spoke model.
36
 This structure not only pleases search engines but also creates a 
better, more organized user experience. 
● 
The Pillar Page (The Hub): This is the centerpiece of the cluster. It is a long-form, 
comprehensive piece of content (often 2,000 words or more) that provides a broad 
overview of a core topic. It should be one of the main subjects the brand wants to be 
known for. For example, a pillar page could be titled ""The Complete Guide to AI Data 
Privacy for Small Businesses"".
36
 This page should be broken down into clear subtopics, 
each of which will be explored in more detail in the cluster content. 
● 
The Cluster Content (The Spokes): These are shorter, more specific articles that each 
dive deep into one of the subtopics mentioned on the pillar page. They are designed to 
rank for the long-tail keywords discovered during the research phase. Following the 
example above, cluster content could include articles like: 
○ 
""How to choose a GDPR-compliant AI vendor"" 
○ 
""On-premise vs. cloud AI: a security comparison"" 
○ 
""Best practices for anonymizing data before AI training"" 
● 
The Power of Internal Linking: The magic of the topic cluster model lies in its internal 
linking structure. Each piece of cluster content (a spoke) must link back to the main pillar 
page (the hub). The pillar page, in turn, should link out to all of its corresponding cluster 
pages. Additionally, related cluster pages should link to each other where relevant.
36
 This 
creates a dense, logically organized web of content around a central theme. This 
structure signals to search engines that the website has a deep and interconnected body 
of knowledge on the topic, thereby establishing topical authority and boosting the 
rankings of all pages within the cluster.
36 
By combining a sharp focus on high-intent, low-competition long-tail keywords with the 
strategic organization of topic clusters, even a brand-new AI SaaS MVP can begin to carve out 
a defensible niche in organic search, attracting the right audience without spending a dime on 
ads. 
 
Chapter 6: The Build-in-Public Flywheel: From Transparency to Trust 
 
In the modern startup landscape, the traditional model of building in stealth, perfecting a 
product behind closed doors, and then revealing it to the world in a ""big bang"" launch is 

becoming increasingly obsolete. A more powerful, community-centric approach has emerged: 
building in public (BiP). This strategy involves openly and consistently sharing the startup's 
journey—from ideation and development to metrics and failures—with an audience in 
real-time.
48
 For a bootstrapped AI SaaS founder, BiP is not just a marketing trend; it is a 
strategic flywheel. It transforms the arduous process of building a company into a public 
narrative that generates feedback, builds unwavering trust, and attracts a loyal base of early 
customers before the product is even officially launched.
50 
 
The ""Build in Public"" (BiP) Framework 
 
At its core, building in public is the practice of radical transparency.
48
 It is about documenting 
the journey, not just creating a polished final product. This involves sharing a wide range of 
information that companies traditionally keep private 
49
: 
● 
Product Development: Sharing roadmaps, feature updates, design mockups, and 
development challenges. 
● 
Business Metrics: Revealing key performance indicators (KPIs) such as user growth, 
website traffic, churn rates, and even revenue (e.g., Monthly Recurring Revenue or MRR). 
● 
Successes and Failures: Celebrating milestones and wins, but also openly discussing 
setbacks, mistakes, and the lessons learned from them. 
● 
Decision-Making: Explaining the reasoning behind strategic pivots, pricing changes, or 
feature prioritization. 
The power of this approach lies in its authenticity. By sharing the raw, unfiltered story of 
building a company, founders humanize their brand and forge a deep, personal connection 
with their audience.
51
 This transparency builds a level of trust that traditional marketing 
campaigns can rarely achieve. For potential customers, following a founder's BiP journey feels 
like being part of an inner circle, transforming them from passive observers into engaged 
supporters and, eventually, passionate evangelists for the product. 
 
Choosing Your Channels and Transparency Level 
 
Building in public does not require baring every single detail of the business. It exists on a 
spectrum, and each founder must determine a level of transparency they are comfortable 
with.
48
 It is crucial to set clear boundaries from the outset to protect sensitive information like 
proprietary algorithms, specific customer data, or internal team conflicts.
51 
● 
The Transparency Spectrum: A founder can choose their level of openness and 

gradually increase it as they build confidence.
48 
○ 
Low Transparency (Starter Level): Sharing product updates, development 
milestones, and general learnings. 
○ 
Moderate Transparency: Introducing selected metrics without absolute numbers 
(e.g., ""User sign-ups grew 50% this month""), and sharing curated stories of 
challenges. 
○ 
High Transparency (Radical): Revealing specific metrics like MRR, churn 
percentage, and detailed revenue breakdowns. 
● 
Choosing the Right Channels: The platform for sharing should align with the target 
audience and the type of content being shared.
48 
○ 
Twitter/X: This is the quintessential BiP platform. It is ideal for quick, frequent 
updates, sharing metrics and screenshots, asking for feedback through polls, and 
engaging in real-time conversations with other founders and potential users. The use 
of hashtags like #buildinpublic and #indiehackers helps content reach a relevant 
audience.
51 
○ 
LinkedIn: This platform is better suited for more professional, in-depth insights into 
business strategy, market analysis, and lessons in leadership. It is an excellent 
channel for reaching corporate decision-makers and building a professional brand. 
The content here tends to be more polished than the rapid-fire updates on Twitter.
48 
○ 
Dedicated Blog or Newsletter: This is the home for long-form, comprehensive 
updates. Monthly or quarterly retrospectives, deep dives into specific business 
challenges, and detailed analyses of growth experiments are perfect for this 
format.
48 
 
A Practical Content Calendar for BiP on Twitter/X and LinkedIn 
 
Consistency is the most critical element of a successful BiP strategy.
49
 Sporadic updates will 
fail to build momentum or a loyal following. A content calendar provides the structure needed 
to share the journey systematically. 
● 
Daily (Primarily on Twitter/X): 
○ 
Share a small win or piece of progress from the day (e.g., ""Just pushed a fix for the 
onboarding flow!""). 
○ 
Post a screenshot or short screen recording of a feature currently in development 
and ask for feedback (e.g., ""Working on the new dashboard. Design A or B?"").
51 
○ 
Share a brief learning or insight (e.g., ""Learned a tough lesson about API rate limiting 
today..."").
54 
○ 
Engage in relevant conversations in the niche by replying with value.
56 
● 
Weekly (Twitter/X Thread and/or LinkedIn Post): 

○ 
Post a summary of the week's achievements in a thread or carousel post. Include key 
metrics like new trial sign-ups, website visitors, or a specific user engagement stat.
51 
○ 
Share a short video update demonstrating a new feature that was completed during 
the week.
54 
○ 
Highlight a major challenge that was overcome and what was learned from it. This 
builds relatability and trust.
54 
● 
Monthly (LinkedIn Article or Blog Post): 
○ 
Write a comprehensive review of the month's progress against the goals set at the 
beginning. 
○ 
Share a deep dive into a specific growth experiment, detailing the hypothesis, the 
execution, the results (even if they were a failure), and the takeaways.
54 
○ 
Discuss a major strategic decision or pivot and the reasoning behind it. 
A crucial element of this strategy is to move beyond simply reporting numbers and to craft a 
compelling narrative arc. The story of the struggle is often more engaging than the story of 
success alone. A founder sharing, ""I had 40 hours of demo meetings last week and I'm 
exhausted, but the feedback has been incredible,"" is far more powerful than just stating a 
revenue figure. This human, relatable content shows vulnerability, which builds connection, 
and it also creates a powerful sense of FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out). Potential customers see 
this intense activity and think, ""Why is everyone meeting with this person? I must be missing 
out,"" which can drive them to book a call themselves.
57 
This consistent, narrative-driven approach effectively turns the founder's public profile into a 
powerful, organic marketing channel. The audience of followers who have opted in to this 
journey becomes the primary, pre-warmed audience for the product launch. Every tweet, 
post, and article serves as a touchpoint, nurturing this audience over time. This process 
functions as a highly effective, free retargeting engine. Instead of paying to show ads to 
people who visited a website once, the founder is continuously engaging a self-selected 
group of interested prospects, building trust and anticipation. By the time launch day arrives, 
a significant portion of this audience is not just aware of the product; they are emotionally 
invested in its success and primed to become its first paying customers. 
 
Chapter 7: Mastering Niche Communities: Reddit & Hacker News 
Engagement 
 
For a technical AI SaaS product, online communities like Reddit and Hacker News represent a 
double-edged sword. They are home to a high concentration of ideal early adopters: 
developers, engineers, and tech enthusiasts who are deeply knowledgeable and influential. A 
successful launch in these communities can generate a massive wave of high-quality traffic, 

invaluable feedback, and the first cohort of paying users. However, these communities are 
also fiercely anti-promotional and possess a finely tuned skepticism for marketing. A clumsy, 
self-serving post will not just be ignored; it will be actively downvoted, flagged, and publicly 
criticized, potentially damaging the brand's reputation before it even gets off the ground. This 
chapter provides a detailed playbook for navigating these high-risk, high-reward 
environments by prioritizing value contribution over self-promotion. 
 
The Unwritten Rules of Reddit Marketing 
 
Reddit is not a single entity; it is a collection of thousands of niche communities, or 
""subreddits,"" each with its own culture, rules, and moderators. The key to success on Reddit is 
to approach it as a member, not a marketer.
59 
● 
Become a Genuine Member First: Before even considering posting about the MVP, the 
founder must become an authentic participant in relevant subreddits. For an AI SaaS, 
these might include r/SaaS, r/startups, r/MachineLearning, r/programming, or more 
specific, industry-focused communities like r/sysadmin or r/devops.
59
 This initial phase 
should last for weeks, if not months, and involve no promotion whatsoever. The activities 
should include 
59
: 
○ 
Commenting Helpfully: Answering questions and offering genuine insights on topics 
where one has expertise. This is the primary way to build credibility. 
○ 
Upvoting Valuable Content: Contributing to the quality of the community by 
upvoting good posts and comments. 
○ 
Learning the Culture: Observing the tone, humor, and unwritten rules of each 
subreddit. 
● 
The 80/20 Rule of Value: A sustainable presence on Reddit is built on a foundation of 
giving. At least 80% of a user's activity should be non-promotional, focused entirely on 
adding value to conversations.
59
 The remaining 20% can involve mentioning the product, 
but only when it is a direct and natural solution to a problem being discussed in a thread.
2
 
A blatant, unsolicited link drop is the fastest way to get banned. 
● 
The Soft Launch and Feedback Request: When the time comes to introduce the MVP, 
the post should be framed as a request for feedback from the community, not as a sales 
announcement. The tone should be humble and transparent. A successful approach 
involves: 
○ 
Telling the Story: Share the journey of building the product, the specific problem it 
was designed to solve, and the progress made so far. A recent founder's post 
detailing their journey to $250 MRR after launching a Reddit marketing tool is a prime 
example of this narrative approach resonating with the r/SaaS community.
61 
○ 
Asking for Specific Feedback: Instead of a generic ""What do you think?"", ask 
targeted questions like, ""We're struggling with the pricing model, does this seem fair 

for the value provided?"" or ""Here's our onboarding flow, where do you think users 
might get confused?"" 
○ 
Offering Value: Consider offering a special discount or extended trial exclusively for 
members of the subreddit as a thank you for their time and feedback. 
 
The Hacker News ""Show HN"" Playbook 
 
Hacker News (HN) is the premier online community for the tech elite. Its audience is highly 
technical, deeply analytical, and allergic to marketing. A successful ""Show HN"" post can drive 
tens of thousands of visitors in a single day, but the rules are strict and unforgiving. 
● 
Understanding ""Show HN"" Eligibility: A ""Show HN"" post is for something tangible that 
users can immediately interact with. This is a hard rule.
62 
○ 
On Topic: A working web app, a downloadable tool, open-source code. 
○ 
Off Topic: Landing pages, waitlist sign-up forms, blog posts, newsletters, or 
fundraisers. The product must be ready for users to try.
62 
○ 
The No-Signup Rule: Ideally, users should be able to try the core functionality 
without needing to sign up or provide an email address. Barriers to entry reduce 
feedback and can lead to negative comments.
62 
● 
Crafting the Perfect ""Show HN"" Post: 
1. 
The Title: The title format is non-negotiable. It must begin with ""Show HN:"".
62
 The 
rest of the title should be a clear, factual, and descriptive statement of what the 
product does. Avoid superlatives like ""fastest,"" ""easiest,"" or ""best,"" as this is seen as 
marketing fluff and will be poorly received.
64
 A good title is unsalesy, like explaining 
the project to a friend: ""Show HN: An open-source tool for visualizing database 
schemas"".
65 
2. 
The Critical First Comment: The submission itself should only contain the URL. The 
text field should be left blank.
63
 Immediately after submitting, the founder must post 
the first comment. This comment is the most important part of the entire launch. It 
should include 
63
: 
■ 
A brief introduction of the founder(s). 
■ 
The backstory: Why was this product built? What personal pain point or 
frustration led to its creation? 
■ 
A clear explanation of the problem it solves. 
■ 
Technical details: What is the tech stack? What was a particularly interesting 
engineering challenge that was overcome? The HN audience loves these details. 
■ 
What makes it different from existing solutions. 
■ 
An explicit invitation for feedback and questions. 
● 
Engaging with the Community on Launch Day: 
○ 
Be Present and Responsive: The founder must be available for the entire day to 

engage with the comments section. Quick, thoughtful responses are crucial for 
building momentum.
64 
○ 
Embrace All Feedback: The HN community is known for its direct and often blunt 
criticism. This should be viewed as a gift. It is free, expert-level feedback. Respond to 
criticism with data, reasoning, and gratitude, not defensiveness. Acknowledge valid 
points and thank users for their insights. This demonstrates maturity and can win 
over the broader audience reading the thread.
64 
○ 
Go Deep on Technicals: When asked technical questions, provide detailed, 
substantive answers. Share code snippets, architecture diagrams, or performance 
benchmarks if relevant. This builds credibility and shows genuine expertise.
17 
● 
The Cardinal Sins of Hacker News: 
○ 
NEVER Ask for Upvotes: Do not ask friends, colleagues, or anyone in a private 
community to upvote the post. HN has sophisticated vote-ring detection algorithms 
that will automatically penalize or ""kill"" the submission. This is the fastest way to fail.
67
 
The goal is to encourage friends to leave thoughtful comments or questions early on 
to spark organic discussion, which is a much stronger ranking signal than upvotes 
alone.
65 
○ 
Don't Use Marketing Speak: Avoid any language that sounds like it came from a 
press release. Use factual, direct, and personal language. The community values 
authenticity and will immediately reject anything that feels like a sales pitch.
63 
By approaching these powerful communities with a mindset of contribution and respect, a 
founder can tap into an unparalleled source of early traction, user feedback, and brand 
validation—all without spending a single dollar. 
 
Part III: The Launchpad: Generating High-Impact Buzz 
 
 
Chapter 8: Guerrilla Marketing for the Digital Age 
 
Guerrilla marketing is a philosophy of asymmetrical warfare. It is the art of the underdog, 
leveraging creativity, surprise, and unconventional tactics to achieve maximum impact with 
minimal resources.
69
 For a SaaS MVP on a shoestring budget, this mindset is not just 
advantageous; it is essential. While traditional guerrilla tactics often involve physical stunts like 
street art or flash mobs, the core principles can be brilliantly adapted to the digital realm.
69
 
This chapter translates the guerrilla ethos into a set of low-cost, high-impact digital strategies 

designed to interrupt patterns, generate buzz, and capture the attention of a target audience 
in unexpected ways. 
 
Core Principles of Digital Guerrilla Marketing 
 
The effectiveness of any guerrilla campaign, whether online or offline, hinges on a few core 
tenets 
70
: 
● 
Creativity Over Cost: The central idea is to substitute a large budget with bold, 
imaginative ideas. The goal is to create a ""pattern interrupt""—an unexpected experience 
that breaks through the noise of conventional marketing and forces people to pay 
attention.
70 
● 
Surprise and Delight: Guerrilla marketing happens when and where the audience least 
expects it. The element of surprise creates an emotional reaction, making the campaign 
more memorable and shareable.
71 
● 
Hyper-Targeted Execution: These campaigns are not broad awareness plays. They are 
surgical strikes aimed at a very specific audience in a specific context. The message and 
execution must be perfectly aligned with the target demographic to resonate 
authentically.
72 
● 
Authenticity is Key: Guerrilla tactics must feel genuine to the brand's identity. An edgy, 
disruptive tactic might work for one brand but could alienate the audience of another. 
The tone must feel unified and true to the company's mission.
70 
 
Digital Guerrilla Tactics for an AI SaaS MVP 
 
Here are five practical, digitally-native guerrilla tactics that can be executed on a minimal 
budget to generate significant buzz for a new AI SaaS product. 
1. 
""Crash the Party"" Digitally:
 
The classic guerrilla tactic of ambushing a competitor's event can be powerfully 
replicated online. The goal is to ""steal"" the attention of an audience that is already 
gathered and focused.71 
○ 
The Tactic: Identify a major virtual conference, webinar, or product launch hosted by 
a large competitor. During the event, execute a multi-pronged digital campaign that 
piggybacks on the event's momentum. 
○ 
Execution: 
■ 
Hashtag Hijacking: Monitor the official event hashtag on Twitter/X and LinkedIn. 
Engage in conversations not by spamming a link, but by offering insightful 

commentary, asking smart questions, and subtly introducing a contrarian or 
complementary viewpoint that relates back to the MVP's unique value 
proposition. 
■ 
Hyper-Targeted Ads: Use the limited ad budget to run ads specifically targeting 
attendees. On LinkedIn, this could be done by targeting people with the job titles 
most likely to attend, who also follow the competitor's company page. The ad 
copy could be cheeky and direct, e.g., ""Enjoying #CompetitorConf? Wait until 
you see how we solve [problem] without the enterprise price tag."" 
■ 
""Alternative"" Content: Publish a blog post or a Twitter thread titled ""The 
Unofficial Guide to [Competitor Conference]"" or ""The One Thing Speakers at 
#CompetitorConf Aren't Talking About,"" which provides genuine value while also 
positioning the MVP as a fresh alternative. 
2. 
The Free Tool or ""Snippet Offer"":
 
This tactic, famously perfected by HubSpot with its Website Grader, involves giving away 
a small piece of value for free to attract and qualify the target audience.73 It lowers the 
barrier to entry, builds trust, and serves as a powerful lead generation magnet. 
○ 
The Tactic: Isolate a small, valuable function from the main AI SaaS product and 
offer it as a free, standalone web tool or API. 
○ 
Execution: 
■ 
Identify the ""Snippet"": If the SaaS product is a private AI model training 
platform, the free tool could be an ""AI Data Anonymizer"" that allows users to 
upload a small dataset and receive a sanitized version. If the product is an 
AI-powered copywriting tool, the free snippet could be a ""Headline Grader"" that 
analyzes the effectiveness of a title. 
■ 
Build a Simple Landing Page: The tool should be hosted on a simple, dedicated 
landing page with a clear value proposition and a single purpose. 
■ 
Promotion: Promote the free tool in niche communities (Reddit, Hacker News), 
on social media, and through targeted outreach. The pitch is not ""try my 
product,"" but ""use this free tool that solves a small but annoying problem."" This 
generates goodwill and attracts a highly relevant audience who can then be 
nurtured towards the main paid product. 
3. 
The Interactive 404 Error Page:
 
A 404 ""Page Not Found"" error is typically a dead end and a point of frustration for a user. 
A guerrilla approach transforms this negative experience into a memorable and delightful 
brand interaction.71 
○ 
The Tactic: Design a custom 404 page that is interactive, entertaining, and 
reinforces the brand's identity. 
○ 
Execution: 
■ 
Slack's Serene Landscape: Slack's 404 page features a beautiful, scrollable 
pastoral scene with animated animals and butterflies. It's unexpected, calming, 
and makes the brand more endearing.
71 
■ 
Kualo's Retro Game: The web hosting company Kualo turned its 404 page into a 
playable version of Space Invaders. Users who score over 1,000 points are 

offered a discount on hosting plans.
71 
■ 
AI SaaS Application: An AI startup could create a simple, text-based adventure 
game on its 404 page powered by a small language model, or a ""404 Error 
Message Generator"" that creates humorous, AI-generated explanations for why 
the page is missing. This costs almost nothing in development time and can 
generate significant word-of-mouth buzz if it's clever enough. 
4. 
Strategic Influencer Gifting (The ""No-Ask"" Approach):
 
Influencer marketing on a shoestring is not about paying for sponsored posts. It is about 
identifying a small, highly relevant group of influencers and providing them with 
overwhelming value with no strings attached.73 
○ 
The Tactic: Identify 15-20 influential figures in the niche—these could be developers 
with popular open-source projects, frequent guests on industry podcasts, or authors 
of respected newsletters. 
○ 
Execution: 
■ 
The Offer: Reach out with a personal, non-templated email. Offer them a free, 
lifetime ""Pro"" account for the SaaS MVP. 
■ 
White-Glove Onboarding: Do not just send them a license key. Schedule a 
30-minute personal call to walk them through the product, set it up for their 
specific use case, and answer any questions. Make it incredibly easy for them to 
start using and seeing value from the tool. 
■ 
The ""No-Ask"": Crucially, ask for nothing in return. Do not ask for a tweet, a 
review, or a mention. The goal is to genuinely help them and build a relationship. 
If the product is truly valuable and solves a problem for them, they will be highly 
likely to mention it organically to their audience out of genuine enthusiasm. This 
organic endorsement is far more powerful and credible than any paid promotion. 
5. 
The Complementary Partnership Program:
 
This tactic leverages the audiences of other companies that already serve the same 
target customer but are not direct competitors.73 
○ 
The Tactic: Identify 5-10 complementary SaaS products that the ideal customer 
profile already uses. For an AI SaaS that helps with data privacy, partners could 
include CRM platforms, analytics tools, or cloud storage providers. 
○ 
Execution: 
■ 
The Pitch: Reach out to the partnership or marketing managers at these 
companies. The offer is simple and mutually beneficial: ""We are willing to provide 
an exclusive, significant discount (e.g., 50% off for the first year) on our new AI 
tool for your customers. This is a no-cost way for you to provide additional value 
to your user base."" 
■ 
Co-Marketing: The partner can then promote this exclusive offer to their 
customers through a newsletter mention, a social media post, or by listing it in 
their integrations marketplace. This provides the MVP with a warm introduction 
to a highly qualified audience, leveraging the trust that the partner has already 
built. 

By employing these digital guerrilla tactics, a SaaS MVP can generate disproportionate 
attention and buzz, punching far above its weight class and building the initial momentum 
needed for a successful launch. 
 
Chapter 9: The Product Hunt Launch Blueprint 
 
Product Hunt is more than just a website; it is a global community of makers, tech enthusiasts, 
investors, and, most importantly, early adopters actively seeking the next big thing.
74
 For a 
new SaaS MVP, a successful launch on Product Hunt can be transformative, driving thousands 
of website visits, generating invaluable feedback, and attracting the first wave of paying 
customers. However, success is not a matter of luck. It is the result of meticulous preparation, 
strategic execution on launch day, and intelligent follow-through. This chapter provides a 
comprehensive, step-by-step blueprint for planning and executing a high-impact Product 
Hunt launch. 
 
Pre-Launch (2-4 Weeks Before) 
 
The foundation for a successful launch is laid weeks in advance. Rushing this phase is the 
most common mistake and a recipe for a launch that fizzles out.
75 
● 
Become an Authentic Community Member: Product Hunt is a community first and a 
launch platform second. Create a personal profile (company accounts are prohibited) at 
least a week, and ideally several months, before the launch.
74
 Use this time to build 
goodwill and credibility by: 
○ 
Participating in Discussions: Engage in conversations, ask thoughtful questions, 
and provide helpful answers. 
○ 
Supporting Other Makers: Genuinely explore other products, leave constructive 
comments, and upvote things that are interesting. This is not about quid pro quo; it's 
about being a good community citizen.
75 
● 
Prepare Your Launch Assets: The quality of the launch page assets is critical for 
capturing attention in a fast-scrolling feed. These are non-negotiable.
75 
○ 
Product Name & URL: The basics. 
○ 
Tagline: A concise (60 characters max), catchy phrase that clearly communicates 
the product's value proposition.
75 
○ 
Thumbnail: This is the most important visual. It must be eye-catching and legible 
even at a small size. An animated GIF is highly recommended as it stands out in the 

feed.
80 
○ 
Gallery: A collection of high-quality images, screenshots, and short GIFs that 
showcase the product in action. Avoid blurry or illegible screenshots. Tools like 
Xnapper can help create beautiful gallery shots.
79
 A short (under 2 minutes) demo 
video is also essential.
78 
○ 
Description: A clear, engaging explanation of the product's features and, more 
importantly, its benefits.
75 
○ 
Maker's Comment: This is the first comment that will appear on the launch page. It 
should be prepared in advance. This is the chance to tell the story behind the 
product: the problem that inspired it, the journey of building it, and what the vision is 
for the future. It should be personal, authentic, and end with a clear ask for feedback 
from the community.
75 
● 
Build Your Launch Team and Supporter List: Assemble a core group of friends, 
colleagues, early users, and advisors who are committed to supporting the launch.
80
 The 
key is how they are instructed to help. Do not ask them to upvote. Instead, ask them to 
be ready on launch day to visit the page, explore the product, and leave a genuine 
comment or question. This initial engagement is crucial for sparking discussion and 
signaling to the algorithm that the launch is interesting.
80 
● 
The Hunter vs. Self-Hunt Decision: In the past, securing a top ""Hunter"" (a prominent 
Product Hunt user who submits the product on the maker's behalf) was seen as essential 
for visibility. This is no longer the case. Data shows that the majority of #1 Product of the 
Day winners are now self-hunted by the makers themselves.
77
 The focus should be on 
building a great product and an engaged community, not on chasing a famous hunter. 
Hunting the product oneself shows a direct investment in the community and is often 
perceived as more authentic.
77 
● 
Create a ""Coming Soon"" Page: Product Hunt's ""Ship"" feature allows makers to create a 
teaser page weeks or months before the actual launch.
75
 This is a powerful tool for 
building anticipation and a dedicated audience. Promote this page to collect email 
subscribers who specifically want to be notified on launch day. 
 
Launch Day (The 24-Hour Sprint) 
 
Launch day is an intense, all-hands-on-deck effort. The founder's calendar should be 
completely cleared to focus on one thing: engaging with the community.
78 
● 
Launch at the Right Time: The Product Hunt day resets at 12:01 AM Pacific Standard 
Time (PST). Launching at this exact time maximizes the product's visibility for the full 
24-hour cycle.
78
 The highest traffic days are typically Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, 
but this also means the competition is fiercest. Launching on a weekend or Monday may 

result in less overall traffic but offers a better chance of ranking higher on the 
leaderboard.
76 
● 
The Critical First Four Hours: The initial hours of the launch are make-or-break. This is 
when the Product Hunt algorithm is evaluating new products to decide which ones to 
feature on the homepage.
76 
1. 
Post the Product: Once the clock strikes 12:01 AM PST, submit the product with all 
the prepared assets. 
2. 
Add the Maker's Comment: Immediately after the page goes live, post the 
pre-written Maker's Comment. 
3. 
Activate Your Network: Announce the launch to the pre-launch email list, social 
media followers, and private communities (Slack, Discord, etc.). Share the direct link 
and ask people to check out the launch and join the conversation.
75 
● 
Engage, Engage, Engage: The single most important activity on launch day is to be 
hyper-responsive in the comments section. The founder should aim to reply to every 
single comment and question personally and thoughtfully.
75
 High levels of genuine 
engagement (maker replies, threaded discussions) are a powerful signal to the Product 
Hunt algorithm and can have a greater impact on ranking than raw upvote numbers.
76 
● 
Promote Across All Channels: 
○ 
Website Banner: Add a banner or pop-up to the product's website that directs 
visitors to the Product Hunt page to show their support.
78 
○ 
Social Media Updates: Post updates on Twitter/X and LinkedIn throughout the day, 
sharing milestones (e.g., ""We just broke into the top 5! Thanks for the amazing 
support!""), tagging supporters, and encouraging more people to join the 
discussion.
76 
 
Post-Launch 
 
The work does not end when the 24-hour launch day is over. The momentum gained must be 
leveraged to drive long-term growth. 
● 
Show Gratitude: Send a thank-you email to everyone on the launch list and all 
supporters, sharing the results of the launch (e.g., final ranking, number of upvotes, 
sign-ups).
80 
● 
Add Social Proof: Add the ""Featured on Product Hunt"" badge to the website's 
homepage. This is a powerful trust signal for future visitors.
80 
● 
Analyze the Results: Dig into the analytics. Track the traffic from Product Hunt, the 
conversion rate to trial or paid sign-ups, and, most importantly, the qualitative feedback 
from the comments. This feedback is an invaluable resource for prioritizing the product 
roadmap.
75 

● 
Share the Story: Write a blog post or a detailed Twitter thread about the launch 
experience. Share the preparation process, the launch day strategy, the final metrics, and 
the key lessons learned. This provides value to other founders and continues to build the 
brand's authority and audience.
82 
A well-executed Product Hunt launch is a powerful catalyst. It's a concentrated burst of 
energy that can validate an MVP, build a community, and kickstart a startup's growth journey. 
 
Chapter 10: Punching Above Your Weight: The Scrappy PR and Media 
Plan 
 
For an early-stage startup, securing media coverage in top-tier publications can feel like an 
insurmountable challenge. The conventional path involves hiring an expensive Public Relations 
(PR) agency with established journalist relationships. However, on a shoestring budget, this is 
not an option. The guerrilla approach to PR involves replacing budget with strategy, creativity, 
and persistence. It is about understanding what makes a story newsworthy, building authority 
through valuable content, and mastering the art of the direct, personalized pitch. This chapter 
provides a practical guide to earning media coverage and high-quality backlinks without an 
agency. 
 
Finding Your Newsworthy Story Angle 
 
The hard truth for most startups is that a product launch, in and of itself, is not news.
85
 
Journalists at major tech publications are inundated with hundreds of launch announcements 
every week. Unless the founder is a well-known figure like Elon Musk or the product is solving 
a major, widely recognized problem in a revolutionary way, a simple ""we launched"" pitch will 
be ignored.
86
 To cut through the noise, the launch must be framed within a larger, more 
compelling narrative. 
Potential story angles that are more likely to capture a journalist's interest include 
85
: 
● 
A Solution to a Timely Trend: Connect the MVP to a broader industry trend that is 
currently in the news cycle. For an AI SaaS, this could be the growing demand for data 
privacy in the age of large language models, the impact of AI on a specific industry's 
workforce, or the debate around AI ethics. The pitch becomes about the trend, with the 
MVP positioned as a key example or solution. 
● 
Proprietary Data and Insights: Journalists love original data because it is unique and 

credible.
88
 Even an early-stage MVP can be a source of interesting data. For example, an 
AI tool that analyzes code could release a small report on ""The Top 5 Most Common 
Security Vulnerabilities in Python Projects."" This data-driven story provides real value and 
positions the company as an expert source, not just a vendor. 
● 
A Compelling Founder Story: The human element can be a powerful hook. If the 
founder has a unique background, overcame significant obstacles, or has a deeply 
personal reason for solving this particular problem, that story can be more engaging than 
the product itself. 
● 
A Powerful Customer Use Case: A story is always more compelling when it has a 
protagonist. Instead of pitching the product, pitch the story of how an early customer 
(ideally a relatable small business or individual) used the MVP to achieve a remarkable 
result. Journalists are more interested in how real people solve problems than in a list of 
software features.
85 
 
Guest Posting for Authority and Backlinks 
 
Guest posting on respected industry blogs is one of the most effective low-cost PR tactics. It 
achieves three critical goals simultaneously: it builds the founder's personal brand as a 
thought leader, it drives referral traffic from a relevant audience, and it generates high-quality 
backlinks, which are essential for SEO.
87 
● 
Finding Guest Post Opportunities: 
○ 
Targeted Google Searches: Use search queries like ""[your niche] + write for us"", 
""[your niche] + guest post guidelines"", or ""[your niche] + submit an article"".
89 
○ 
Competitor Backlink Analysis: Use the free versions of SEO tools like Ahrefs or 
Semrush to see which blogs are linking to competitors. Many of these links will be 
from guest posts, revealing a list of publications that are open to contributions. 
○ 
Prospecting Lists: Several online resources provide lists of tech blogs that accept 
guest submissions. Sites like TechDogs, Tech Research Online, and WikiGlitz are 
actively looking for content on topics like AI, software development, and startups.
90 
● 
Crafting the Perfect Pitch: Editors are busy and receive countless pitches. A generic, 
self-promotional pitch will be deleted immediately. 
○ 
Focus on Their Audience: The pitch must be framed around the value the proposed 
article will provide to the blog's readers, not the value it will provide to the founder's 
company.
37 
○ 
Do the Research: Thoroughly read the blog's existing content and its guest post 
guidelines. The pitch should demonstrate a clear understanding of their audience, 
tone, and the topics they cover.
38 
○ 
Personalize and Be Concise: Address the editor by name. Keep the email brief and 
to the point. Reference a recent article they published to show that the outreach is 

not a mass blast.
37 
○ 
Pitch Ideas, Not a Finished Article (Usually): Unless the guidelines specify 
otherwise, it is often better to pitch 2-3 unique, well-researched topic ideas with brief 
outlines, rather than sending a full, unsolicited article.
37 
● 
Writing a High-Value Guest Post: 
○ 
Provide Genuine Expertise: The content must be educational, actionable, and 
objective. It should be backed by research, data, and real-world examples.
37 
○ 
Follow the Rules: Adhere strictly to the publication's style guide, word count 
requirements, and formatting guidelines.
37 
○ 
Strategic Linking: Most publications will allow one or two links back to the author's 
website within the body of the article or in the author bio. These links should be 
contextual and point to a relevant, non-promotional resource (like a blog post or a 
free tool), not directly to a sales page.
92 
 
Pitching Journalists and Niche Bloggers Directly 
 
Direct outreach to journalists is a high-effort, high-reward activity. A single well-placed story 
in a major publication can have a massive impact. 
● 
Building a Targeted Media List: Mass-emailing a generic press release is a waste of 
time.
94
 The key is to build a small, highly curated list of individual journalists, reporters, 
and bloggers who specifically cover the startup's niche. 
○ 
Finding the Right People: Use Twitter/X's search function and LinkedIn to find 
reporters who are writing about AI, SaaS, or the specific industry the MVP serves. 
Follow them, engage with their work, and understand their ""beat"".
95
 Tools like Muck 
Rack can help, and curated lists like the one from VC Sheet provide names of specific 
startup reporters at publications like Axios, Bloomberg, and Forbes who cover AI.
97 
● 
The Art of the Email Pitch: The pitch email is a critical first impression. It must be 
perfect. 
1. 
A Compelling Subject Line: The subject line must be clear, concise, and intriguing 
without being clickbait. ""Interview Opportunity"" is a common pet peeve of 
journalists.
94
 A better approach is to lead with the most newsworthy element, e.g., 
""Story Idea: New data shows 70% of SMBs are vulnerable to AI data leaks."" 
2. 
Personalize the Opening: The first sentence must show this is not a mass email. 
Reference a specific, recent article the journalist wrote to demonstrate genuine 
familiarity with their work.
87 
3. 
Get to the Point Quickly: The body of the email should be no more than 150-300 
words. Clearly and concisely present the story angle (from the list above), explain 
why it is relevant to their audience now, and highlight what makes it unique.
96 

4. 
Offer Value and Exclusivity: Offer the journalist an exclusive on the story, provide 
access to the proprietary data, or position the founder as an expert source they can 
quote for this and future articles.
96 
5. 
Provide a Press Kit: Include a single link to a press kit (e.g., a Dropbox or Google 
Drive folder) containing high-resolution logos, product screenshots, founder 
headshots, and a concise fact sheet. Do not use attachments.
94 
● 
Email Templates for Outreach: Providing structured templates can demystify the 
pitching process. 
○ 
Product Launch Template: ""Subject: Launching [Product Name]: A new tool for 
[their audience]. Hi [Journalist's Name], I've been following your work on [their 
beat]... Your recent article on [specific article] was insightful. On, we're launching 
[Product Name], a tool designed to help [target audience] solve [specific problem]... 
We believe it's different because [key differentiator]. I've prepared a press kit and 
would be happy to provide an exclusive demo..."".
99 
○ 
Expert Source Template: ""Subject: Source for your story on [relevant topic]. Hi 
[Journalist's Name], I follow your work on [their beat]... Our founder, [Expert's Name], 
has deep expertise in [area of expertise] and can offer a clear perspective on 
[newsworthy angle 1], [newsworthy angle 2]... Would you be open to a brief 
introductory call?"".
99 
By adopting these scrappy, strategic PR tactics, a SaaS founder can build relationships, earn 
valuable media mentions, and generate the kind of third-party validation that money can't 
buy. 
 
Part IV: The Accelerator: The $500/Month Paid 
Acquisition Machine 
 
 
Chapter 11: Precision Targeting on a Micro-Budget with Google Ads 
 
With a monthly advertising budget of just $500, there is absolutely no room for error, waste, 
or experimentation with broad awareness campaigns. Every dollar must be deployed with 
surgical precision, targeting only those potential customers who are actively searching for a 
solution and are closest to making a purchase decision. This chapter details a ""sniper"" 
approach to Google Ads, a hyper-focused strategy designed to capture high-intent search 
traffic and generate qualified leads, even with a budget that most marketers would deem 

impossibly small. 
 
The ""Sniper"" Campaign Structure 
 
Forget complex account structures with dozens of campaigns and ad groups. On a 
micro-budget, simplicity and focus are paramount. The entire strategy revolves around a 
single, meticulously configured Google Search campaign. 
● 
Campaign Setup and Objective: 
○ 
Campaign Type: Create one Search campaign. Avoid Performance Max, Display, or 
Video campaigns, as they are designed for broader reach and will quickly exhaust a 
small budget on low-intent traffic.
100 
○ 
Campaign Objective: The objective must be set to Leads or Sales. Do not select 
""Website traffic."" This signals to Google's algorithm that the goal is to find users who 
are likely to perform a specific conversion action, not just click on an ad.
101 
○ 
Location Targeting: Be specific. If the MVP is primarily for US-based businesses, 
target only the United States. Do not use the default ""United States and Canada."" 
○ 
Networks: In the campaign settings, uncheck the boxes for ""Search Network"" and 
""Display Network."" This ensures ads only appear on Google's own search results 
page, which is the highest-intent placement, and prevents the budget from being 
spent on lower-quality partner sites.
102 
● 
The High-Intent Keyword Strategy:
 
This is the heart of the sniper approach. The keyword selection must be ruthless, 
focusing exclusively on long-tail keywords that signal a user is ""solution-aware"" or 
""product-aware"" and actively looking to buy. 
○ 
Match Types: Use only Phrase Match (""like this"") and Exact Match ([like this]). 
Do not use Broad Match. Broad Match gives Google too much leeway to match 
queries, which will result in irrelevant clicks and wasted spend, a luxury a small 
budget cannot afford.
100 
○ 
Keyword Modifiers: The keywords should contain commercial or transactional intent 
modifiers. These include terms like 
46
: 
■ 
Solution-based: ""software,"" ""platform,"" ""tool,"" ""solution"" 
■ 
Comparison-based: ""alternative,"" ""vs,"" ""comparison,"" ""review"" 
■ 
Use-case based: ""for [specific industry],"" ""for [specific task]"" 
○ 
Example Keywords: 
■ 
[private ai model training software] 
■ 
""ai privacy compliance tool for small business"" 
■ 
""[competitor name] alternative"" 
● 
Aggressive Use of Negative Keywords:
 
A negative keyword list is just as important as the target keyword list. It acts as a shield, 

preventing ads from showing for irrelevant searches. A comprehensive negative keyword 
list should be built from day one and continuously updated based on the Search Terms 
report. 
○ 
Initial Negative List: Include common informational and non-commercial terms like 
-free, -jobs, -course, -tutorial, -degree, -pdf, -student, -example.
101 
○ 
Ongoing Refinement: Review the Search Terms report weekly to identify irrelevant 
queries that triggered ads and add them as negative keywords. 
 
Bidding and Budgeting on a Shoestring 
 
With a $500 monthly budget, the daily budget is approximately $16.67. This is extremely tight, 
especially in a competitive B2B SaaS market where CPCs can easily exceed $20.
103 
● 
Budgeting: Set the daily budget and be prepared for Google to sometimes spend up to 
double that amount on a given day, while ensuring the monthly total does not exceed the 
budget.
101
 The expectation must be realistic; this budget might only generate a handful of 
clicks per day. The goal is to make every single click count. 
● 
Bidding Strategy: 
○ 
Recommended Starter: Begin with the Maximize Conversions automated bidding 
strategy. This tells Google to use its machine learning to bid for clicks that are most 
likely to result in a conversion, given the daily budget constraints.
100 
○ 
Avoid: Do not start with Target CPA (Cost Per Acquisition) or Target ROAS 
(Return on Ad Spend). These strategies require a significant volume of historical 
conversion data (typically 30-50 conversions in the last 30 days) to function 
effectively, which a new campaign on a small budget will not have.
100 
○ 
Alternative for Control: For experienced advertisers who want maximum control, 
Manual CPC is a viable option. This allows setting a maximum bid for each keyword, 
but it requires more hands-on management.
101 
 
Ad Group Organization and Ad Copy 
 
The ad groups should be small and tightly themed to ensure maximum relevance between the 
keyword, the ad copy, and the landing page. This improves Quality Score, which can lower 
CPCs. 
● 
Ad Group Structure: 
○ 
Ad Group 1: Core Use Case: Keywords related to the primary problem the MVP 

solves (e.g., ""private AI model software""). 
○ 
Ad Group 2: Niche Audience: Keywords targeting a specific vertical (e.g., ""AI for 
legal document analysis""). 
○ 
Ad Group 3: Competitor Alternatives: Keywords targeting users searching for 
competitors (e.g., ""[competitor] alternative"").
46
 This can be a very effective, albeit 
sometimes expensive, way to capture high-intent traffic. 
● 
Ad Copy: The ad copy must speak directly to the searcher's intent. 
○ 
Headlines: Use Responsive Search Ads with up to 15 headlines. Pin the most 
important message (the core value proposition) to position 1 to ensure it always 
shows.
104
 Include headlines that address pain points, highlight unique benefits, and 
use a clear call-to-action (CTA) like ""Request a Demo"" or ""Start Your Trial"".
21 
○ 
Descriptions: Elaborate on the benefits mentioned in the headlines. Include trust 
signals like ""Trusted by..."" or specific results like ""Reduce audit prep time by 80%"".
103 
 
The Non-Negotiable Role of Conversion Tracking 
 
Without accurate conversion tracking, running Google Ads on any budget is like flying blind; 
on a micro-budget, it is financial suicide. It is the single most critical step in the setup 
process.
100 
● 
Primary Conversions: Set up conversion tracking for the most important business goals, 
such as a paid sign-up, a free trial start, or a demo request form submission. 
● 
Micro-Conversions: Because the volume of primary conversions will be low initially, it is 
crucial to also track ""micro-conversions."" These are smaller, indicative actions that users 
take on the path to becoming a customer. Tracking these provides the Google Ads 
algorithm with more data points to learn from. Examples include 
100
: 
○ 
Downloading a whitepaper or case study. 
○ 
Signing up for a newsletter. 
○ 
Watching more than 75% of a demo video. 
○ 
Spending more than 3 minutes on the pricing page. 
By implementing this disciplined, sniper-like approach, a SaaS MVP can strategically use a 
small Google Ads budget to validate keyword intent, generate a small but steady stream of 
highly qualified leads, and gather the data needed to justify a larger investment in the future. 
 
Chapter 12: Social Ads for a Niche B2B Audience (Facebook & 
LinkedIn) 

 
While Google Ads excels at capturing existing demand, social advertising platforms like 
LinkedIn and Facebook are powerful tools for generating new demand and reaching 
decision-makers where they spend their time. However, for a B2B SaaS MVP with a $500 
monthly budget, a traditional ""spray and pray"" approach is not feasible. Success requires a 
strategic allocation of the budget, leveraging the unique strengths of each platform, and 
employing advanced targeting techniques to reach a niche B2B audience with maximum 
efficiency. 
 
The Strategic Platform Choice: LinkedIn for Data, Facebook for Cost 
 
LinkedIn and Facebook present a classic trade-off for B2B advertisers: precision versus cost. 
● 
LinkedIn: This is the undisputed king of B2B targeting. Its platform is built on 
member-generated professional data, allowing for unparalleled granularity in targeting by 
job title, function, seniority, industry, company size, and specific skills.
105
 For reaching 
specific decision-makers like ""Chief Information Security Officers at FinTech companies 
with 50-200 employees,"" there is no better platform. However, this precision comes at a 
premium price. LinkedIn's Cost Per Click (CPC) and Cost Per Lead (CPL) are significantly 
higher than on other platforms, making it challenging to scale on a small budget.
108 
● 
Facebook (Meta): In contrast, Facebook offers a massive user base and much lower 
advertising costs.
109
 The challenge has always been its B2B targeting capabilities, which 
are based on inferred interests and behaviors rather than self-reported professional 
data.
109
 Targeting ""Interests: Software Engineering"" is far less precise than targeting ""Job 
Title: Senior Software Engineer."" 
The shoestring strategy is to combine the strengths of both: use LinkedIn's data for precision 
and Facebook's scale and cost-efficiency for delivery. 
 
Advanced Targeting on a Small Budget: The Key to ROI 
 
Given the budget constraints, broad targeting is out of the question. The focus must be on 
reaching the most qualified prospects possible. 
● 
LinkedIn Targeting (If Budget Allows): If a portion of the budget is allocated to 
LinkedIn (e.g., for a very small, high-value test campaign), the targeting should be as 
narrow as possible. The combination of Job Functions and Seniority (e.g., Function: 

Engineering, Seniority: Senior, Director, VP) often provides the best balance of reach and 
relevance without being overly restrictive.
110
 Avoid broad interest targeting. 
● 
The Facebook Lookalike Audience Hack: This is the core strategy for making Facebook 
work for B2B on a budget. It leverages first-party data to effectively replicate LinkedIn's 
targeting precision at a fraction of the cost. 
1. 
Create a Seed Custom Audience: The first step is to create a high-quality ""seed"" 
audience. This is a list of known, valuable contacts that is uploaded to Facebook. This 
can be a list of 
108
: 
■ 
Existing early users or paying customers (even a small list of 50-100 is a start). 
■ 
Leads who have signed up for a trial or requested a demo. 
■ 
A curated list of ideal prospects from a CRM or even a spreadsheet.
 
Facebook will then match the email addresses or phone numbers on this list to 
user profiles on its platform to create a Custom Audience.111 
2. 
Build a 1% Lookalike Audience: Once the Custom Audience is created, the next 
step is to create a Lookalike Audience. This instructs Facebook's algorithm to 
analyze the thousands of data points associated with the people in the seed list and 
find other users on the platform who share similar characteristics, behaviors, and 
demographics. By selecting a 1% lookalike in a specific country (e.g., United States), 
the advertiser is telling Facebook to find the top 1% of users in that country who are 
most similar to their best customers or prospects.
108
 This is an incredibly powerful 
way to find a highly relevant B2B audience on a platform that lacks native 
professional targeting options.",,2025-10-11 23:08:31.637789+00,2025-10-11 23:10:35.582436+00,f15f4a68-3268-452d-b4b0-e863f807db58,completed,f15f4a68-3268-452d-b4b0-e863f807db58/1760224111004-Shoestring_AI_SaaS_MVP_Marketing_Guide_Short_V5.pdf,651505,"{""mime_type"":""application/pdf"",""uploaded_at"":""2025-10-11T23:08:31.577Z"",""original_filename"":""Shoestring AI SaaS MVP Marketing Guide Short V5.pdf""}",completed,21,,pdf,,,100,,2025-10-11 23:08:32.415+00,2025-10-11 23:08:34.975+00
