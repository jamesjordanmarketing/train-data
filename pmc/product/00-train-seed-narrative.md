## 🚀 Big Picture

**4-Word Vision:**  
Automate. Control. Quality. Scale.

**One-Sentence Summary:**  
The Interactive LoRA Conversation Generation Module transforms the manual, error-prone console-based process of creating training conversations into an intuitive, UI-driven workflow that empowers non-technical business experts to generate, filter, review, and manage high-quality synthetic conversation datasets through intelligent prompt templates, multi-dimensional filtering, and real-time progress tracking.

**The Core Problem:**  
After categorizing documents and extracting semantic chunks with 60 dimensions, businesses need to generate 90-100 high-quality training conversations that authentically reflect their unique expertise, customer interactions, and communication style. The current approach requires manually copying JSON prompts into Claude console one at a time, with no progress visibility, no batch processing, no database storage, and no quality review workflow. This manual process is error-prone, time-consuming, and fundamentally does not scale to the hundreds of conversations required for effective LoRA fine-tuning.

**How Life Changes:**  
Business experts log into Bright Run and see a clean conversation dashboard displaying all potential conversation scenarios derived from their emotional taxonomy, persona profiles, and content categories. With sophisticated filtering by persona, emotion, topic, intent, and tone, they generate conversations individually or in batches with a single click. Real-time progress indicators show exactly which conversation is being generated. The formatted review interface lets them approve, reject, or flag conversations for editing. The system handles all technical complexity—prompt templates, parameter injection, API orchestration, validation, database storage—while giving users complete visibility and control. Export approved conversations as structured JSON ready for the LoRA training pipeline.
