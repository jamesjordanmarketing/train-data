- **Non-Technical Focus**: All personas can succeed without technical AI/ML knowledge

### Journey Scope and Boundaries
The journey encompasses the complete transformation from raw business knowledge (documents, transcripts, expertise) to production-ready LoRA training datasets. It explicitly focuses on proof-of-concept demonstration without authentication, user management, data silos, or enterprise features, prioritizing the core value delivery of knowledge transformation and multiplication.

### Success Definition
Success is measured by users completing the full workflow in under 2 hours for their first project, achieving 95%+ approval rates for generated training pairs, and realizing 10-100x multiplication of their manual examples while maintaining their unique voice and methodology throughout all generated content.

### Value Progression Story for Proof-of-Concept
The journey creates a compelling proof-of-concept by demonstrating immediate value in Stage 1 (project organization), building foundation in Stage 2 (automated processing), showcasing intelligence in Stage 3 (knowledge exploration), proving expertise capture in Stage 4 (customized generation), validating quality in Stage 5 (collaborative review), and delivering exponential value in Stage 6 (synthetic expansion).
