## 4. Advanced Content Adaptation

- **FR4.1.0:** Style and Tone Adaptation
  * Description: Implement comprehensive style and tone adaptation that creates multiple style variations, adapts tone for different contexts, adjusts language for specific audiences, preserves core voice characteristics, and provides quality assessment for style consistency.
  * Impact Weighting: Revenue Impact
  * Priority: High
  * User Stories: US2.1.2
  * Tasks: [T-4.1.0]
  * User Story Acceptance Criteria:
    - Multiple style variations (formal, casual, technical, conversational)
    - Tone adaptation (professional, friendly, authoritative, supportive)
    - Audience-specific language adjustments
    - Preservation of core voice characteristics
    - Quality assessment for style consistency
  * Functional Requirements Acceptance Criteria:
    - Style variation generation creates formal, casual, technical, conversational, and academic versions of content
    - Tone adaptation produces professional, friendly, authoritative, supportive, and empathetic variations
    - Audience-specific adaptation adjusts vocabulary, complexity, and examples for target demographics
    - Voice characteristic preservation maintains essential personality traits and communication patterns across variations
