## 6. Quality Assurance and Validation

- **FR6.1.0:** Visual Quality Assessment
  * Description: Implement comprehensive visual quality assessment that provides side-by-side content comparison, highlights key concepts and relationships, visualizes quality scores with explanations, offers efficient sampling tools, and integrates feedback for continuous improvement.
  * Impact Weighting: Operational Efficiency
  * Priority: Medium
  * User Stories: US4.2.1
  * Tasks: [T-6.1.0]
  * User Story Acceptance Criteria:
    - Side-by-side comparison of source and generated content
    - Visual highlighting of key concepts and relationships
    - Quality score visualization with explanations
    - Sampling tools for efficient manual review
    - Feedback integration for quality improvement
  * Functional Requirements Acceptance Criteria:
    - Side-by-side interface displays source content and generated pairs with synchronized navigation and highlighting
    - Difference highlighting shows preserved, modified, and new content with color coding and annotations
    - Concept highlighting identifies key ideas, entities, and relationships in both source and generated content
    - Visual quality score presentation through charts, progress bars, and detailed breakdowns
    - Explainable metrics provide detailed explanations of scoring factors with specific examples and recommendations
    - Sampling tools enable random, stratified, and targeted selection of content for efficient manual review
    - Quality trend visualization shows improvements and degradation over time with statistical analysis
    - Interactive filtering allows users to focus on specific quality dimensions, content types, or score ranges
    - Annotation tools enable reviewers to mark issues, add comments, and suggest improvements
    - Feedback integration captures user assessments and incorporates them into quality improvement algorithms
    - Comparison modes support different views including unified diff, split view, and overlay comparison
    - Quality heatmaps visualize quality distribution across different content sections and generation parameters
    - Export capabilities generate quality assessment reports with visualizations and detailed analysis
    - Quality benchmark comparison shows performance against industry standards and historical baselines
    - Real-time quality monitoring provides immediate feedback during content generation processes

## Document Purpose
1. Break down User Stories into manageable functional requirements
2. Define clear acceptance criteria for each requirement
3. Maintain traceability between requirements, user stories, and tasks
4. Provide clear "WHAT" specifications for task generation
5. Enable validation of feature completeness against user needs
6. Establish comprehensive foundation for LoRA training data platform development

## Requirement Guidelines
1. Each requirement should map to one or more user stories
2. Requirements should focus on WHAT, not HOW
3. Both User Story and Functional Requirements acceptance criteria should be measurable
4. Technical details belong in the task specifications
5. Requirements should be understandable by non-technical stakeholders
6. All requirements must contribute to high-quality LoRA training data generation

## Document Generation Workflow
1. User Stories document is referenced
2. Functional Requirements are created based on stories
3. Implementation tasks are derived from requirements
4. Traceability is maintained across all artifacts
5. Requirements are validated against both sets of acceptance criteria
6. New requirements identified through expert analysis and system integration needs

## Requirement Mapping Guide
1. Each requirement has a unique identifier (FR[X.Y.Z])
2. Requirements map to one or more user stories (US[X.Y.Z])
3. Requirements map to one or more tasks (T[X.Y.Z])
4. Requirements break down into specific tasks
5. Quality metrics are defined for validation
6. Cross-functional requirements ensure system integration and operational excellence

## Requirement Structure Guide
1. Description: Clear statement of what the feature should do
2. Impact Weighting: Business impact category
3. Priority: Implementation priority level
4. User Stories: Mapping to source user stories
5. Tasks: Mapping to implementation tasks
6. User Story Acceptance Criteria: Original criteria from user story
7. Functional Requirements Acceptance Criteria: Additional specific criteria for implementation
