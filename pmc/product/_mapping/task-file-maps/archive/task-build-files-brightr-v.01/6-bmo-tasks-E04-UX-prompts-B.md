- **FR Reference:** FR-4.1.3
- **Parent Task:** T-4.3.0
- **Implementation Location:** `src/components/workflow/export/`
- **Pattern:** Wizard Interface with Preview
- **Dependencies:** T-4.3.2
- **Estimated Human Work Hours:** 5-7
- **Description:** Flexible export system with format configuration and download management

**Components/Elements:**
- [T-4.3.3:ELE-1] Export format wizard: Step-by-step export configuration with format selection
  - Design Prompt: "Design an export configuration wizard with step-by-step format selection. Show format options (HuggingFace, JSON, JSONL, CSV) as large cards with icons and descriptions. Include field mapping interface with drag-and-drop columns, export preview section, and advanced options accordion. Add export queue management and download progress tracking. Use wizard-style navigation with clear steps and preview capabilities."
  - Input/Output/View: Export format selection, field mapping, configuration options → Export configuration, format preview, download management → Wizard interface with format cards and configuration panels
- [T-4.3.3:ELE-2] Professional reporting system: Automated report generation with customizable templates
  - Design Prompt: "Create a report generation interface with template selection, customization options, and preview capabilities. Show report templates as thumbnail previews with descriptions, include section customization with drag-and-drop components, and provide real-time preview panel. Add export options (PDF, HTML, Word), sharing controls, and report scheduling. Use document-style layout with clear template organization and preview functionality."
  - Input/Output/View: Report templates, customization options, data selections → Generated reports, export formats, sharing options → Template gallery with customization panel and preview area
- [T-4.3.3:ELE-3] Export management dashboard: Download tracking and history management
  - Design Prompt: "Design an export management interface showing export history, current exports in progress, and download management. Include a table with export details (date, format, size, status), progress bars for active exports, download buttons for completed exports, and export scheduling options. Add search/filter controls and bulk management actions. Use table-based layout with clear status indicators and action controls."
  - Input/Output/View: Export history, current export status, management commands → Export tracking, download management, scheduling controls → Table interface with status tracking and management controls

**Implementation Process:**
1. Preparation Phase:
   - [PREP-1] Design export wizard flow and format selection interface (implements ELE-1)
   - [PREP-2] Plan professional reporting system with template management (implements ELE-2)
   - [PREP-3] Create export management dashboard design (implements ELE-3)
2. Implementation Phase:
   - [IMP-1] Build export configuration wizard with format options (implements ELE-1)
   - [IMP-2] Implement professional reporting system with template customization (implements ELE-2)
   - [IMP-3] Create export management dashboard with download tracking (implements ELE-3)
   - [IMP-4] Add export queue management and progress tracking (implements ELE-1, ELE-3)
3. Validation Phase:
   - [VAL-1] Test export wizard functionality and format generation (validates ELE-1)
   - [VAL-2] Verify professional reporting system and template customization (validates ELE-2)
   - [VAL-3] Test export management and download tracking (validates ELE-3)

## Mobile-Responsive Design Considerations

### Mobile Workflow Navigation
**Design Prompt:**
"Create mobile-optimized versions of the workflow interface with collapsible navigation, swipe gestures between stages, and touch-friendly controls. Show stage progress as a horizontal scrollable timeline, use bottom sheet modals for configuration, and implement pull-to-refresh for status updates. Prioritize essential actions and use progressive disclosure for advanced features."

### Mobile Data Input
**Design Prompt:**
"Design mobile-friendly file upload with camera integration for document scanning, voice-to-text input options, and simplified configuration with preset templates. Use full-screen modals for text editing, thumb-friendly touch targets, and clear visual feedback for all interactions."

### Mobile Results Viewing
**Design Prompt:**
"Create mobile dashboard with swipeable metric cards, simplified charts optimized for small screens, and touch-friendly export options. Use bottom navigation for main sections, implement infinite scroll for training pairs, and provide quick actions through swipe gestures."

## Accessibility Design Requirements

### Screen Reader Optimization
**Design Prompt:**
"Ensure all interface elements include proper ARIA labels, semantic HTML structure, and keyboard navigation support. Design focus indicators, skip navigation links, and alternative text for all visual elements. Include high contrast mode support and scalable text options."

### Keyboard Navigation
**Design Prompt:**
"Design clear tab order through all interface elements, keyboard shortcuts for common actions, and escape key functionality for modals. Ensure all interactive elements are reachable via keyboard and provide visual focus indicators."
