- Error handling provides specific error messages and recovery options for each stage
- Stage dependencies are enforced with automatic validation before proceeding
- Pipeline state is preserved and can be resumed from any stage if interrupted
- Processing time estimates are provided for each stage based on data volume
- Quality gates prevent low-quality content from proceeding to subsequent stages
- Batch processing supports multiple datasets with queue management
- Real-time progress updates show current stage, completion percentage, and estimated time remaining
- Pipeline configuration allows adjustment of processing parameters for each stage
- Export functionality generates final datasets in HuggingFace format with proper metadata
- Pipeline logs maintain complete audit trail of processing decisions and transformations

#### T-1.1.1: Pipeline State Management System
- **FR Reference**: FR-1.1.1
- **Parent Task**: T-1.1.0
- **Implementation Location**: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\BRun\brun3a\src\core\pipeline\state`
- **Pattern**: P001-PIPELINE-ORCHESTRATION
- **Dependencies**: None
- **Estimated Human Work Hours**: 3-4
- **Description**: Implement pipeline state management with persistence and recovery capabilities

**Components/Elements**:
- [T-1.1.1:ELE-1] Pipeline state persistence: Implement state saving and loading mechanisms
  - Stubs and Code Location(s): `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\BRun\brun3a\src\core\state\pipeline-state.ts:1-50` (state management patterns)
- [T-1.1.1:ELE-2] Stage progress tracking: Track completion status and progress for each stage
  - Stubs and Code Location(s): `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\BRun\brun3a\src\core\progress\stage-tracker.ts:1-30` (progress tracking)
- [T-1.1.1:ELE-3] Error recovery system: Handle failures and enable pipeline resumption
  - Stubs and Code Location(s): `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\BRun\brun3a\src\core\error\recovery-handler.ts:1-40` (error handling)

**Implementation Process**:
1. Preparation Phase:
   - [PREP-1] Design pipeline state schema and data structures (implements ELE-1)
   - [PREP-2] Define stage progress metrics and tracking requirements (implements ELE-2)
   - [PREP-3] Plan error recovery strategies and failure scenarios (implements ELE-3)
2. Implementation Phase:
   - [IMP-1] Create pipeline state persistence layer with database integration (implements ELE-1)
   - [IMP-2] Implement stage progress tracking with real-time updates (implements ELE-2)
   - [IMP-3] Build error recovery system with automatic retry mechanisms (implements ELE-3)
   - [IMP-4] Add state validation and consistency checks (implements ELE-1, ELE-2)
3. Validation Phase:
   - [VAL-1] Test state persistence across browser sessions (validates ELE-1)
   - [VAL-2] Verify progress tracking accuracy and real-time updates (validates ELE-2)
   - [VAL-3] Test error recovery with various failure scenarios (validates ELE-3)
