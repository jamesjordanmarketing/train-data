# The Bright Run LoRA Fine-tuning Training Data Platform - Document Categorization Module - Task Execution Plan

## Overview

This task execution plan transforms the Document Categorization Module functional requirements into specific, actionable tasks that validate and enhance the existing Next.js 14 implementation in `4-categories-wf\`. Each task includes explicit deliverables and prerequisites to maintain workflow continuity and ensure comprehensive validation of the categorization system.

**Key Constraint:** This plan focuses on validating and enhancing the existing Next.js 14 with app router implementation rather than building from scratch. All tasks must contribute directly to confirming the 3-step categorization workflow functions correctly and saves data to Supabase.
