- FR FR1.1.0 Wireframes — Stage 1 — Foundation and Infrastructure Layer

Context Summary
- This flow covers document processing for multi-file uploads with diverse formats, providing an intuitive drag-and-drop experience, queue management, and transparent progress feedback. Users can validate files, see clear errors with remediation, preview extracted content with formatting options, and confirm metadata preservation before proceeding. Constraints include large file support (up to 100MB per file) and batch operations with clear status visibility.

Wireframe Goals
