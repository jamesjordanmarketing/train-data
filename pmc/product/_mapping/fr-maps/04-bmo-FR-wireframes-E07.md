    - Proper formatting with instruction-response pairs
    - Metadata preservation in export format
    - Batch export capabilities for large datasets
    - Export validation and format compliance checking
    - Format validation ensuring compliance with LoRA requirements
    - Content quality validation with scoring metrics
    - Duplicate detection and removal capabilities
    - Training data statistics and quality reports
    - Pre-export validation with error reporting and resolution guidance
  * Functional Requirements Acceptance Criteria:
    - Multi-format export support includes JSONL, CSV, HuggingFace Datasets, Parquet, and custom JSON schemas with configurable field mapping
    - LoRA format compliance ensures proper instruction-response pair structure with system prompts, user inputs, and assistant responses correctly formatted
    - Metadata preservation includes all categorization tags, quality scores, source attribution, and generation parameters in export files
    - Batch export processing handles large datasets (100K+ pairs) with progress tracking, resume capabilities, and memory-efficient streaming
    - Export validation performs comprehensive checks for format compliance, data integrity, encoding consistency, and structural correctness
    - Quality assurance validation ensures exported pairs meet minimum quality thresholds with score-based filtering and manual override options
    - Duplicate detection algorithms identify and remove redundant content using semantic similarity and exact match detection methods
    - Content validation verifies question-answer coherence, response completeness, and instruction clarity before export inclusion
    - Training data statistics generate comprehensive reports including pair counts, quality distributions, topic coverage, and metadata analysis
    - Pre-export validation provides detailed error reporting with specific issues identified and suggested resolution actions
    - Export customization enables users to select specific subsets, apply filters, and configure output structure based on training requirements
    - Format transformation automatically converts internal data structures to target export formats with data type preservation and encoding optimization
    - Quality reporting generates export summaries including success metrics, filtered content statistics, and validation results
    - Integration testing validates exported data compatibility with popular LoRA training frameworks and tools

- **FR7.1.2:** Dataset Analytics and Metrics
  * Description: Implement comprehensive dataset analytics and metrics system that provides detailed analysis of training data characteristics, quality distributions, topic coverage, voice consistency, and ROI calculations to enable users to understand and validate the value and effectiveness of their generated training datasets.
  * Impact Weighting: Strategic Growth
