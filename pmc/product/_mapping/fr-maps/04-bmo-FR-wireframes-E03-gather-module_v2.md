# Enhanced Data Gathering Module - Functional Requirements v2

**Version:** 2.0.0  
**Date:** January 2025  
**Scope:** Enhanced Data Gathering Module (gather-module)  
**Based on:** Data Gathering Analysis v2 and Existing Categorization Module

## Executive Summary

This document defines the functional requirements for the **Enhanced Data Gathering Module (gather-module)** - an intelligent expansion of the Document Categorization Module that adds AI-driven document analysis, business context capture, and voice preservation capabilities. The module transforms the existing 3-step workflow into a comprehensive 5-step knowledge intelligence system that captures not just categorization, but the deep contextual metadata required for high-quality LoRA training data generation.

**Key Enhancement:** This module adds AI-powered document analysis with business-friendly validation, eliminating the need for chunk-level tagging while gathering 10x more contextual metadata than the original categorization system.

## Standard Operating Method for AI-Human Collaboration

**CRITICAL METHODOLOGY:** For every US-GAT-### user story in this specification, the standard operating method follows this three-phase pattern:

### Phase 1: AI Provisional Analysis
- **AI analyzes** document content and chunks it into meaningful segments
- **AI provisionally understands** the content context, purpose, and value
- **AI labels** key concepts, methodologies, patterns, and business elements
- **AI compares** content against established frameworks and categories
- **AI categorizes** findings into structured metadata types
- **AI names** and characterizes identified elements with descriptive labels

### Phase 2: Human Approval Presentation
- **System presents** all AI provisional assessments to the human user
- **Clear visual indicators** distinguish between AI-generated and human-validated content
- **Structured interface** displays each category of analysis for easy review
- **Confidence indicators** show AI certainty levels for each assessment
- **Context explanations** help users understand the reasoning behind AI conclusions

### Phase 3: Human Direct Editing
- **Human can approve** any or all provisional assessments with simple confirmation
- **Human can directly edit** any AI assessment inline with rich text capabilities
- **Human can remove** incorrectly identified elements with single-click actions
- **Human can add** missed elements that AI didn't identify
- **Human can refine** descriptions, definitions, and characterizations
- **System preserves** all human edits and treats them as authoritative

**Implementation Note:** This AI-first, human-validated approach ensures high-quality metadata capture while respecting human expertise and domain knowledge. Every US-GAT-### user story implements this pattern to maintain consistency and usability.
