# Stage 1 LoRA Proof of Concept - Minimal Viable Pipeline (v2)

## Overview

This document defines a streamlined Stage 1 implementation focused on the core components necessary for a LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) training pipeline proof of concept. Based on the analysis in `04-bmo-FR-wireframes-output-E01-spread-across.md`, this version includes only the critical infrastructure and processing components while excluding advanced features that are not essential for the initial proof of concept.

## Scope and Objectives

### Primary Goal
Create a minimal viable pipeline that demonstrates the core LoRA training workflow:
1. Workspace creation and management
2. Basic document processing and validation
3. Dataset export configuration for LoRA training
4. Error handling and recovery
5. Data ownership and processing transparency

### Stage 2 Compatibility
This Stage 1 implementation is designed to integrate seamlessly with Stage 2 (E02) content processing pipeline, ensuring a smooth transition from basic setup to advanced content processing.

- Recovery guidance for processing failures
- Progress preservation for interrupted sessions
- Retry mechanisms for failed operations

## Excluded Features (Non-Critical for Proof of Concept)

### Privacy & Data Ownership Control Center
**Reason for Exclusion**: Advanced privacy controls are not needed for proof of concept
**Simplified Alternative**: Basic data ownership controls included in FR1.1.2

### Performance Optimization & Efficiency Dashboard
**Reason for Exclusion**: Advanced optimization not needed for initial proof of concept
**Simplified Alternative**: Basic monitoring included in FR1.1.1 dashboard

### FR1.3.0 - Training Platform
**Reason for Exclusion**: Full training platform too complex for proof of concept
**Alternative Approach**: LoRA pipeline will use external training tools initially

### Advanced Collaborative Features
**Reason for Exclusion**: Multi-user collaboration not essential for proof of concept
**Future Integration**: Can be added in later stages

## Implementation Architecture

### Minimal Viable Pipeline Flow

1. **Workspace Initialization** (FR1.1.1)
   - User creates new LoRA training project
   - Basic dashboard setup
   - Activity logging initialization

2. **Document Upload & Processing** (FR1.1.0)
   - Upload reference documents and training materials
   - Basic validation and queue management
   - File preview and organization

3. **Dataset Configuration** (FR1.2.0)
   - Configure export settings for LoRA training
   - Set up batch processing parameters
   - Define dataset versioning

4. **Processing Transparency** (FR1.1.2)
   - Monitor processing progress
   - Access processed data
   - Maintain data ownership controls

5. **Error Management** (FR1.1.3)
   - Handle processing errors gracefully
   - Provide recovery options
   - Preserve progress state

### Stage 2 Integration Points

- **Data Handoff**: Processed files from FR1.1.0 feed into E02's advanced processing pipeline
- **Configuration Sharing**: Export settings from FR1.2.0 inform E02 processing parameters
