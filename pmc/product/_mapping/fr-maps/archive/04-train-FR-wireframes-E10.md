**Reorganization Notes:**
This document has been reorganized to follow logical build dependencies:
1. Foundation Layer (Database, Core Services)
2. Infrastructure Layer (API Integration, Error Handling)
3. Base Components Layer (UI Components, Templates)
4. Primary Features Layer (Generation, Review, Export)
5. Advanced Features Layer (Analytics, Optimization)
6. Cross-Cutting Layer (Performance, Security, Testing)

All FR numbers have been updated. Original User Story (US) references preserved for traceability.

## 10. Performance & Scalability

### 10.1 Generation Speed

- **FR10.1.1:** Single Conversation Generation Speed
  * Description: Optimized performance for individual conversation requests
  * Impact Weighting: User Experience / Time-to-Value
  * Priority: Medium
  * User Stories: US12.3.1
  * Tasks: [T-10.1.1]
  * User Story Acceptance Criteria:
    - Average generation time: 15-45 seconds
    - Fast path for simple conversations (<8 turns): 10-20 seconds
    - Progress indicator during generation
    - Timeout after 90 seconds with retry option
    - Performance monitoring showing average generation time per tier
    - Alert if generation time exceeds 60 seconds consistently
  * Functional Requirements Acceptance Criteria:
    - [To be filled]

- **FR10.1.2:** Batch Generation Speed
  * Description: Parallel processing optimization for batch operations
  * Impact Weighting: User Experience / Time-to-Value
  * Priority: Medium
  * User Stories: US12.3.2
  * Tasks: [T-10.1.2]
  * User Story Acceptance Criteria:
    - Batch of 100 conversations: 30-60 minutes total time
    - Parallel processing: 3 conversations simultaneously (where API limits allow)
    - Progress updates every 2-5 seconds
    - Time estimates based on actual generation rates (not fixed estimate)
    - Optimization: group similar conversations to reuse prompt templates
    - Performance report showing actual vs. estimated time
  * Functional Requirements Acceptance Criteria:
    - [To be filled]
