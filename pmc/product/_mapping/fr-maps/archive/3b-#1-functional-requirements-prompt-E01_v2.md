# Functional Requirements Enhancement Prompt - Part 1

## Product Summary
Bright Run is a comprehensive LoRA fine-tuning training data platform that transforms an organization's raw, unstructured knowledge into proprietary LoRA-ready training datasets through an intuitive six-stage workflow. We're creating a sophisticated yet accessible platform that enables non-technical users to create custom LLMs that think with their unique knowledge, beliefs, and proprietary processes while maintaining complete data ownership and privacy.

Bright Run's frontier AI application sets a new standard for generative AIâ€“driven growth by enabling non-technical customers the ability to generate thousands of semantically rich synthetic LoRA training questions through a structured data extraction and modern fine-tuning pipeline.

## Your Role
You are a team of senior technical product managers with extensive experience in enterprise software development, system architecture, and product lifecycle management. 

## Context
Your task is to enhance and expand the functional requirements document for the project by adding detailed acceptance criteria and identifying new requirements.

## CRITICAL RULES FOR DOCUMENT HANDLING

1. **Preservation of Existing Content**
   - NEVER delete or remove existing sections
   - NEVER remove existing requirements
   - ALL existing content must be preserved and/or enhanced

2. **Document Completeness**
   - You MUST process the ENTIRE `C:/Users/james/Master/BrightHub/BRun/brun5a/pmc/product/03-bmo-functional-requirements.md` document from start to finish
   - You MUST maintain ALL existing sections
   - You MUST maintain the existing section numbering scheme

3. **Enhancement Approach**
   - Start with the existing document at `C:/Users/james/Master/BrightHub/BRun/brun5a/pmc/product/03-bmo-functional-requirements.md`
   - For each section:
     a. Preserve all existing content
     b. Enhance existing requirements with more detail
     c. Add new requirements where gaps are identified
     d. Ensure consistent depth across all requirements
     e. Do not create duplicate requirements or sections

4. **Validation Requirements**
   - Each section must maintain or expand its current depth
   - Each requirement must be as detailed as the most detailed existing requirement
   - New requirements must match or exceed the detail level of existing ones
   - All sections must be processed, with no truncation

## File Handling Instructions

### 1. Input/Output File Handling
1. File Specification:
   - Input and output file: `C:/Users/james/Master/BrightHub/BRun/brun5a/pmc/product/03-bmo-functional-requirements.md`       
   - You MUST process the ENTIRE `C:/Users/james/Master/BrightHub/BRun/brun5a/pmc/product/03-bmo-functional-requirements.md` document from start to finish
   - Modify this file directly - do not create new files
   - Generate a complete updated version of the entire document
   - Maintain the existing markdown format 

2. Processing Requirements:
   - Read through all existing functional requirements in the file before starting any work
   - Process requirements in place, maintaining the original file structure
   - Add new requirements under appropriate sections
   - Preserve all existing headers and structure
   - Maintain consistent level of detail across all requirements
   - ENSURE ALL SECTIONS ARE PROCESSED TO COMPLETION

3. **Change Logging Requirements**
   - Each atomic change MUST be logged individually in `pmc/product/_tools/cache/bmo-fr-changes.log`:
   - Each FR modification MUST generate multiple log entries, one for each:
     * Acceptance criteria movement or modification
     * Priority or impact weight change
     * Description modification
     * User Story reference change
     * Append to the change log file, do not overwrite it.
   - FORMAT: [ID/Type] -> [Action] -> [Destination] | REASON: [Detailed Rationale]
   - Related changes MUST be grouped using change group IDs:

### 2. Sequential Processing
1. Process requirements in sequential order through ALL sections
2. Maintain requirement hierarchy in the file structure
3. Follow the template structure from `C:/Users/james/Master/BrightHub/BRun/brun5a/pmc/product/_prompt_engineering/3b-functional-requirements-prompt_v1.md`
4. Track progress through sections to ensure completion

### 3. File Update Process
1. Read the current content of `C:/Users/james/Master/BrightHub/BRun/brun5a/pmc/product/03-bmo-functional-requirements.md`
2. Process one section at a time
3. For each section:
   a. Preserve existing content
   b. Enhance existing requirements
   c. Add new requirements
   d. Validate completeness
4. Continue until ALL sections are processed
5. Verify no sections were truncated or skipped

## Analysis Steps

### 1. Review Existing Functional Requirements
- Analyze each FR from the initial document
- Identify gaps in the functional requirements
- Note any areas that need more granular breakdown
- Flag any ambiguous or incomplete requirements
- ENSURE ALL EXISTING REQUIREMENTS ARE PRESERVED
- Track sections to ensure complete coverage

### 2. Enhance FR Acceptance Criteria
For each existing FR:
- Add new FR-specific acceptance criteria that focus on:
  * Measurable outcomes
  * System behaviors
  * Integration points
  * Performance metrics
  * Quality attributes
- Ensure criteria are testable and verifiable
- Match or exceed the detail level of the most detailed existing criteria

### 3. Granular Requirement Analysis
For each FR:
- Preserve existing detail and structure
- Analyze if each acceptance criterion should be its own FR
- Analyze if acceptance criteria suggest additional sub-requirements
- Break down complex requirements into modular components
- Identify implicit functionality that needs explicit requirements
- Create new FRs for significant sub-components
- Maintain clear parent-child relationships in numbering
- You MUST transform User Acceptance Criteria into testable acceptance criteria
- Ensure consistent depth across all requirements

### 4. Overview Document Integration
CRITICAL: You MUST:
- Read the project overview document thoroughly
- Identify requirements mentioned in overview but missing from FRs
- Create new FRs for any functionality described in overview but not described in the USs
- Cross-reference overview sections in new FRs
- Flag any conflicts between overview and existing FRs
- Identify system-wide requirements that may have been overlooked
