# Interactive LoRA Conversation Generation - Functional Requirements
**Version:** 3.0.0 (Wireframe Integration)
**Date:** 10/28/2025  
**Category:** Training Data Generation Platform
**Product Abbreviation:** train

- Previous Version: `pmc\product\03-train-functional-requirements-before-wireframe.md`
- Wireframe Codebase: `train-wireframe\src\`
- Main Codebase: `src\`

**Reorganization Notes:**
This document has been enhanced with insights from the implemented wireframe UI and main codebase integration. All functional requirements now include:
- Testable acceptance criteria based on actual implementation
- Direct codebase file path references for validation
- Enhanced UI/UX specifications from wireframe patterns
- Database schema validation from implemented models
- API endpoint specifications from actual routes

All FR numbers preserved from v2.0.0 for traceability. Original User Story (US) references maintained.

## Document Enhancement Summary

**Key Enhancements in v3.0.0:**
1. **UI Component Integration**: All UI requirements now reference actual wireframe components
2. **Database Validation**: Acceptance criteria validated against implemented Supabase schemas  
3. **API Specification**: Requirements include actual API endpoint paths and parameters
4. **State Management**: Requirements reference Zustand store implementation patterns
5. **Type Safety**: All data structures validated against TypeScript type definitions
6. **Testable Criteria**: Every acceptance criterion now includes validation approach

**Wireframe Components Integrated:**
- Dashboard with conversation table, filters, pagination (ConversationTable.tsx, FilterBar.tsx)
- Three-tier workflow (TemplatesView.tsx, ScenariosView.tsx, EdgeCasesView.tsx)
- Batch generation interface (BatchGenerationModal.tsx)
- Review queue system (ReviewQueueView.tsx)
- Export functionality (ExportModal.tsx)
- Quality metrics visualization (Dashboard stats cards)

  * Tasks: [T-10.1.1]
  * Functional Requirements Acceptance Criteria:
    - API errors must be caught and displayed with user-friendly messages
      Code Reference: `src/app/api/chunks/generate-dimensions/route.ts`
    - Rate limit errors must trigger automatic retry with backoff
      Code Reference: `src/lib/ai-config.ts`
    - Network errors must display with retry option
    - Database errors must be logged and sanitized before user display
      Code Reference: `src/lib/database.ts`
    - Generation failures must be saved with error details for debugging
    - Toast notifications must distinguish error types: temporary, permanent, action required
    - Error boundary must catch React errors and display fallback UI
    - Error logs must be aggregated and searchable

- **FR10.1.2:** Data Recovery
  * Description: Mechanisms to recover from partial failures and data corruption
