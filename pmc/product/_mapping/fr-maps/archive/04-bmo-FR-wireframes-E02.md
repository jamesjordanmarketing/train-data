    - Drag-and-drop interface provides visual feedback with hover states, drop zones, and upload confirmation animations
    - Upload progress tracking displays individual file progress, batch progress, and estimated completion times with pause/resume capabilities
    - File validation performs virus scanning, size limits (up to 100MB per file), format verification, and content accessibility checks
    - Batch upload processing handles up to 50 files simultaneously with queue management and prioritization options
    - Error handling provides specific error messages for file format issues, size limits, corruption, and network failures with retry mechanisms
    - Document preview generates thumbnail images and text excerpts for immediate content verification after upload
    - Metadata extraction captures file properties, creation dates, authors, and document statistics for organization and tracking
    - Upload queue management allows users to reorder, remove, or add files during processing with real-time status updates
    - File name normalization handles special characters, length limits, and duplicate names with intelligent conflict resolution
    - Content encoding detection automatically identifies character encoding for international content and converts to UTF-8
    - Upload resume functionality allows interrupted uploads to continue from breakpoint without restarting entire files

- **FR2.1.2:** Automated Content Processing
  * Description: Implement an intelligent automated content processing pipeline that extracts, cleans, normalizes, and structures content from diverse document formats while preserving essential information and removing technical artifacts to prepare clean, usable content for knowledge processing.
  * Impact Weighting: Operational Efficiency
  * Priority: High
  * User Stories: US2.1.2
  * Tasks: [T-2.1.2]
  * User Story Acceptance Criteria:
    - Automatic removal of technical artifacts (headers, footers, pagination)
    - Format normalization across different content types
    - Text extraction from PDFs and other complex formats
    - Content structure preservation while removing noise
    - Processing status indicators with clear progress feedback
  * Functional Requirements Acceptance Criteria:
    - Text extraction algorithms process PDF, DOCX, HTML, and RTF formats with OCR capabilities for image-based text
    - Artifact removal automatically detects and eliminates headers, footers, page numbers, watermarks, and boilerplate content
    - Content structure preservation maintains paragraph breaks, headings, lists, and logical document hierarchy during cleaning
    - Format normalization converts all content to consistent UTF-8 plain text with preserved semantic markup
    - Noise reduction filters remove redundant whitespace, formatting artifacts, and non-content elements while preserving meaning
    - Language detection identifies document language for appropriate processing rules and character handling
    - Processing pipeline provides real-time status updates showing current stage, completion percentage, and estimated time remaining
    - Quality assessment evaluates extraction success rate, content completeness, and processing confidence scores
    - Content validation ensures extracted text maintains readability and coherence compared to original documents
    - Table extraction preserves tabular data structure and relationships for documents containing structured information
    - Image and media handling identifies embedded content and provides appropriate placeholders or descriptions
    - Error recovery mechanisms handle corrupted files, password-protected documents, and unsupported format variations
    - Processing optimization adapts algorithms based on document characteristics for improved speed and accuracy
    - Preprocessing logs maintain detailed records of all transformations applied for transparency and debugging

- **FR2.1.3:** Document Organization and Status Tracking
  * Description: Implement a comprehensive document management system with organized table views, real-time status tracking, intelligent categorization, and advanced search capabilities to provide users complete visibility and control over their document processing pipeline.
  * Impact Weighting: Operational Efficiency
  * Priority: Medium
  * User Stories: US2.1.3, US2.1.4
  * Tasks: [T-2.1.3], [T-2.1.4]
  * User Story Acceptance Criteria:

    - Clear processing status indicators (uploaded, processing, complete, error)
    - Document categorization and tagging capabilities
    - Search and filter functionality for document management
    - Document removal and re-upload capabilities
    - Real-time processing status updates with progress percentages
    - Clear indication of current processing stage and estimated completion time
