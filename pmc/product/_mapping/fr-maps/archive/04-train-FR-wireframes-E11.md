## Document Purpose
1. Break down User Stories into manageable functional requirements
2. Define clear acceptance criteria for each requirement
3. Maintain traceability between requirements, user stories, and tasks
4. Provide clear "WHAT" specifications for task generation
5. Enable validation of feature completeness against user needs

## Requirement Guidelines
1. Each requirement should map to one or more user stories
2. Requirements should focus on WHAT, not HOW
3. Both User Story and Functional Requirements acceptance criteria should be measurable
4. Technical details belong in the task specifications
5. Requirements should be understandable by non-technical stakeholders

## Document Generation Workflow
1. User Stories document is referenced
2. Functional Requirements are created based on stories
3. Implementation tasks are derived from requirements
4. Traceability is maintained across all artifacts
5. Requirements are validated against both sets of acceptance criteria

## Requirement Mapping Guide
1. Each requirement has a unique identifier (FR[X.Y.Z])
2. Requirements map to one or more user stories (US[X.Y.Z])
3. Requirements map to one or more tasks (T[X.Y.Z])
4. Requirements break down into specific tasks
5. Quality metrics are defined for validation

## Requirement Structure Guide
1. Description: Clear statement of what the feature should do
2. Impact Weighting: Business impact category
3. Priority: Implementation priority level
4. User Stories: Mapping to source user stories
5. Tasks: Mapping to implementation tasks
6. User Story Acceptance Criteria: Original criteria from user story
7. Functional Requirements Acceptance Criteria: Additional specific criteria for implementation

## Reorganization Summary

This document has been reorganized from the original 14 feature-based sections into 11 build-dependency-ordered sections:

**Original Structure:**
1. Conversation Generation Core
2. Progress Monitoring & Visibility
3. Filtering & Organization
4. Review & Approval Workflow
5. Export & Integration
6. Dashboard & Table Management
7. Prompt Template Management
8. Three-Tier Architecture
9. Database & Data Management
10. Integration with Existing Modules
11. User Experience & Interface
12. Performance & Scalability
13. Cost Tracking & Transparency
14. Administration & Settings

**New Structure:**
1. Database Foundation & Core Schema (Foundation Layer)
2. AI Integration & Generation Engine (Infrastructure Layer)
3. Core UI Components & Layouts (Base Components Layer)
4. Primary Generation Features (Primary Features Layer)
5. Dashboard & Data Organization (Primary Features Layer)
6. Review & Approval System (Primary Features Layer)
7. Three-Tier Conversation Architecture (Advanced Features Layer)
8. Data Export & Integration (Advanced Features Layer)
9. Cost Tracking & Transparency (Cross-Cutting Layer)
10. Performance & Scalability (Cross-Cutting Layer)
11. Administration & User Settings (Cross-Cutting Layer)

**Key Changes:**
- Reorganized by logical build dependencies (database → API → UI → features)
- ALL FRs renumbered sequentially (FR1.1.1 through FR11.2.2)
- Original User Story references (US) preserved for traceability
- Consolidated persona-specific acceptance criteria into unified requirements
- No requirements removed (all are product-focused)
- Minimal duplication found (well-structured originally)
- Total: 73 functional requirements organized across 11 sections

This organization enables developers to implement in logical sequence, building foundation before features, while maintaining complete traceability to user stories and business value.
