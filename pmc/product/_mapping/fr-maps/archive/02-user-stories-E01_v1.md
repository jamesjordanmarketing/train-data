  - *As an enterprise IT leader, I want error reporting APIs so that issues are tracked systematically*
  - **Impact Weighting**: Operational Efficiency
  - **Acceptance Criteria**:
    - Report errors to backend
    - Include error context and stack traces
    - Track user actions leading to errors
    - Support error categorization
    - Enable error analytics
    - Maintain error history
  - **Priority**: Low
  - **FR Mapping**: [To be populated during FR generation]

## Document Generation Workflow
1. This document (User Stories) is generated first
2. Functional Requirements document is generated based on these stories
3. FR numbers are automatically mapped back to relevant user stories
4. This document is updated with FR mappings
5. Both documents maintain bidirectional traceability

## User Story Mapping Guide
1. Each user story is assigned a unique identifier (USx.x.x)
2. The numbering system provides a foundation for functional requirements
3. FR mappings are added during functional requirements generation
4. Priority levels help in implementation planning
5. Acceptance criteria guide functional requirement creation
6. Impact Weighting helps prioritize development based on business value
