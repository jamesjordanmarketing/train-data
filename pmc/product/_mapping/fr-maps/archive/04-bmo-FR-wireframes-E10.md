## Document Purpose
1. Break down User Stories into manageable functional requirements
2. Define clear acceptance criteria for each requirement
3. Maintain traceability between requirements, user stories, and tasks
4. Provide clear "WHAT" specifications for task generation
5. Enable validation of feature completeness against user needs

## Requirement Guidelines
1. Each requirement should map to one or more user stories
2. Requirements should focus on WHAT, not HOW
3. Both User Story and Functional Requirements acceptance criteria should be measurable
4. Technical details belong in the task specifications
5. Requirements should be understandable by non-technical stakeholders

## Document Generation Workflow
1. User Stories document is referenced
2. Functional Requirements are created based on stories
3. Implementation tasks are derived from requirements
4. Traceability is maintained across all artifacts
5. Requirements are validated against both sets of acceptance criteria

## Requirement Mapping Guide
1. Each requirement has a unique identifier (FR[X.Y.Z])
2. Requirements map to one or more user stories (US[X.Y.Z])
3. Requirements map to one or more tasks (T[X.Y.Z])
4. Requirements break down into specific tasks
5. Quality metrics are defined for validation

## Requirement Structure Guide
1. Description: Clear statement of what the feature should do
2. Impact Weighting: Business impact category
3. Priority: Implementation priority level
4. User Stories: Mapping to source user stories
5. Tasks: Mapping to implementation tasks
6. User Story Acceptance Criteria: Original criteria from user story
7. Functional Requirements Acceptance Criteria: Additional specific criteria for implementation
