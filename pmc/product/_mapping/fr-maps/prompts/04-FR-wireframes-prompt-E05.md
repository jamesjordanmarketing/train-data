# FR5.1.1 — Wireframe Generator Prompt (v4)

## FR Wireframes Prompt Generator (v4) — Generates a Figma-Ready Wireframe Prompt

Goal: Read local source documents for a specific FR, extract all acceptance criteria, and output a single, self-contained prompt that can be pasted into Figma Make AI to generate wireframes. This file is a generator prompt (prompt-to-create-a-prompt).

Inputs (local to generator)
- Overview: `pmc/product/01-bmo-overview.md`
- User Stories: `pmc/product/02-bmo-user-stories.md`
- Functional Requirements: `pmc/product/03-bmo-functional-requirements.md`
- Task-Specific FR Map: `pmc/product/_mapping/fr-maps/04-bmo-FR-wireframes-E05.md`
- User Journey: `pmc/product/03.5-bmo-user-journey.md`

Parameters
- FR Number: FR5.1.1
- Stage Name: Stage 5 — Quality Control and Review Workflow
- Section ID: E05 (E.g., E01)
- Journey Stage Number: 5 (1-6)
- Minimum Page Count: 3 (default: 3)
- FR Locate File: pmc/product/_mapping/fr-maps/prompts/04-FR-wireframes-prompt-E05.md
- FR Locate Line: 1
- Output File (append): pmc/product/_mapping/fr-maps/04-bmo-FR-wireframes-output-E05.md

Mandates
- Locate FR FR5.1.1 in pmc/product/_mapping/fr-maps/prompts/04-FR-wireframes-prompt-E05.md at line 1.
- Append the final Figma-ready prompt for this FR between explicit markers to: pmc/product/_mapping/fr-maps/04-bmo-FR-wireframes-output-E05.md.
- Use the following markers when writing the final output block:
  - === BEGIN PROMPT FR: FR5.1.1 ===
  - === END PROMPT FR: FR5.1.1 ===

What to do
0) Extract journey context for Stage 5:
   - User goals and workflows for this stage
   - Emotional journey points
   - Success celebration moments
   - Progressive disclosure requirements
   - Persona-specific UI adaptations
1) Identify FR FR5.1.1 in the Task-Specific FR Map (or the main FR file if not present) and collect all acceptance criteria:
   - User Story Acceptance Criteria mapped to this FR
   - Functional Requirements Acceptance Criteria for this FR
2) Classify each criterion as UI-relevant vs Non-UI.
3) Compute a Page Plan (≥ 3) to satisfy all UI-relevant criteria with clear flows and states.
4) Generate a self-contained Figma Make AI prompt that embeds all UI-relevant criteria, includes annotations instructions, and does not require external file access.

Final Output Format (append to pmc/product/_mapping/fr-maps/04-bmo-FR-wireframes-output-E05.md)

=== BEGIN PROMPT FR: FR5.1.1 ===

Title
- FR FR5.1.1 Wireframes — Stage 5 — Quality Control and Review Workflow

Context Summary
- [2–4 sentences tailored to FR: scope, user value, constraints]

Journey Integration
- Stage 5 user goals: [extracted from journey]
- Key emotions: [confidence building, anxiety reduction, celebration]
- Progressive disclosure levels: [basic, advanced, expert]
- Persona adaptations: [unified interface serving all personas]



### Journey-Informed Design Elements
- User Goals: Quality validation, Review workflow, Approval process
- Emotional Requirements: Quality indicators, Decision confidence, Achievement celebration
- Progressive Disclosure:
  * Basic: Automated quality checks
  * Advanced: Manual review interface
  * Expert: Custom validation rules
- Success Indicators: Quality confirmed, Review completed, Approval granted
  
Wireframe Goals
- [Bulleted goals mapped to this FR]

Explicit UI Requirements (from acceptance criteria)
- [Each UI-relevant criterion rewritten as concrete UI elements, components, states, interactions]
- Include validation, error, loading, empty, success, disabled, in-progress states as applicable

Interactions and Flows
- [Describe navigation and key interactions required by the criteria]

Visual Feedback
- [Progress indicators, status chips, ETAs, logs, toasts—as required]

Accessibility Guidance
- [Focus, labels, aria hints, color contrast]

Information Architecture
- [Layout groups and hierarchy]

Page Plan
- [List the screens with names and purposes; count must match computed plan]

Annotations (Mandatory)
- Instruct: Attach notes on elements citing the acceptance criterion they fulfill and include a “Mapping Table” frame in Figma: Criterion → Screen → Component(s) → State(s).

Acceptance Criteria → UI Component Mapping
- [For each UI-relevant criterion: text, source (US/FR), screen(s), component(s), state(s), notes]

Non-UI Acceptance Criteria
- [List all non-UI criteria with impact and any UI hint]

Estimated Page Count
- [Number and brief rationale tied to criteria]

=== END PROMPT FR: FR5.1.1 ===

Notes
- Keep copy realistic for actionable UI. Avoid referencing local files in the Figma prompt content.
- Do not include features from other FRs beyond minimal navigation context.
- Use the markers exactly to delineate where each prompt starts and ends; there will be multiple prompts in the same output file for a section.
