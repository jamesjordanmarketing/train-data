# Category to Conversation Pipeline Execution Directions

## Overview

You are going to convert our UI fixes specification into a usable Executable plan with 3 segmented prompts.

## Background Files to Read

Read all of these:

- `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\train-data\pmc\product\04-categories-to-conversation-strategic-overview_v1.md`
- `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\train-data\pmc\product\04-categories-to-conversation-pipeline-spec_v1.md`

To understand the specification read and fully understand the codebase of this application located here:

- `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\train-data\src\`

You will be asked to search it and find solutions.

## Problem Description

Some important data bridge upgrades are needed to make the application functional. The data bridge upgrades are specified here:
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\train-data\pmc\product\04-categories-to-conversation-pipeline-spec_v1.md`

I need you to build an execution plan from this specification using our Execution Plan Execution Instructions:

### Execution Plan Execution Instructions

1. Your job is to create the execution instructions to implement this specification in a sequence of 3 prompts, each of which will be submitted to a new contextless `Claude-4.5-sonnet Thinking LLM`input. This specification merits 3 prompts in specific unique sequential prompts.

2. **Include prompts** to submit to the `Claude-4.5-sonnet Thinking LLM` to execute the product build and coding changes.  
   - You must be able to cut and paste these prompts into a **200k Claude-4.5-sonnet Thinking context window in Cursor**.
   - The prompts must be directive.

3. Make sure you **do not leave any context or instructions outside of the prompts**.  
   The building agent will only see what is in the prompt(s).

4. **Organize successive prompts** so that each one can be executed in a new 200k token context window.  
   Each should be modular — the next prompt should not need to finish the previous component.

5. **Avoid duplication.**  
   Do not include the same code/query/details outside the prompt sections if that information is already inside the prompts.

6. **Formatting requirement for copy-paste sections:**

   - At the **beginning** of any cut-and-paste block, insert:
     ```
     ========================     
     

     ```
   - At the **end** of any cut-and-paste block, insert:
     ```
     +++++++++++++++++
     
     
     
     ```
7. When you create this specification You **must** take into account the actual state of the database and code. This means before building this specification you must validate all assumptions and facts by reading the relevant codebase and database.

8. For all Supabase operations use the Supabase Agent Ops Library (SAOL):
**Library location:** `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\train-data\supa-agent-ops\`  
**Quick Start Guide:** `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\train-data\supa-agent-ops\saol-agent-quick-start-guide_v1.md`

9. Use this file: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\train-data\pmc\product\_mapping\fr-maps\04-FR-wireframes-execution-E05.md` as an example and a template of a good execution file.

10. **Create the final execution file here:** `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\train-data\pmc\product\_mapping\unique\cat-to-conv-P01\04-cat-to-conv-execution-E01.md'
