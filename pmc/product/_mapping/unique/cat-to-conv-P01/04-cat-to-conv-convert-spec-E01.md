# Category to Conversation Pipeline Execution Directions

## Overview

You are going to convert our UI fixes specification into a usable Executable plan with 3 segmented prompts.

## Background Files to Read

Read all of these:

- `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\train-data\pmc\product\04-categories-to-conversation-strategic-overview_v1.md`
- `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\train-data\pmc\product\04-categories-to-conversation-pipeline-spec_v1.md`

To understand the specification read and fully understand the codebase of this application located here:

- `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\train-data\src\`

You will be asked to search it and find solutions.

## Problem Description

Some important data bridge upgrades are needed to make the application functional. The data bridge upgrades are specified here:
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\train-data\pmc\product\04-categories-to-conversation-pipeline-spec_v1.md`

I need you to build an execution plan from this specification using our Execution Plan Execution Instructions:

### Execution Plan Execution Instructions

1. Your job is to create the execution instructions to implement this specification in a sequence of 3 prompts, each of which will be submitted to a new contextless `Claude-4.5-sonnet Thinking LLM`input. This specification merits 3 prompts in specific unique sequential prompts.

2. **Include prompts** to submit to the `Claude-4.5-sonnet Thinking LLM` to execute the product build and coding changes.  
   - You must be able to cut and paste these prompts into a **200k Claude-4.5-sonnet Thinking context window in Cursor**.
   - The prompts must be directive.

3. Make sure you **do not leave any context or instructions outside of the prompts**.  
   The building agent will only see what is in the prompt(s).

4. **Organize successive prompts** so that each one can be executed in a new 200k token context window.  
   Each should be modular — the next prompt should not need to finish the previous component.

5. **Avoid duplication.**  
   Do not include the same code/query/details outside the prompt sections if that information is already inside the prompts.

6. **Formatting requirement for copy-paste sections:**

   - At the **beginning** of any cut-and-paste block, insert:
     ```
     ========================     
     

     ```
   - At the **end** of any cut-and-paste block, insert:
     ```
     +++++++++++++++++
     
     
     
     ```
7. When you create this specification You **must** take into account the actual state of the database and code. This means before building this specification you must validate all assumptions and facts by reading the relevant codebase and database.

8. For all Supabase operations use the Supabase Agent Ops Library (SAOL):
**Library location:** `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\train-data\supa-agent-ops\`  
**Quick Start Guide:** `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\train-data\supa-agent-ops\saol-agent-quick-start-guide_v1.md`

9. Use this file: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\train-data\pmc\product\_mapping\fr-maps\04-FR-wireframes-execution-E05.md` as an example and a template of a good execution file.

10. **Create the final execution file here:** `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\train-data\pmc\product\_mapping\unique\cat-to-conv-P01\04-cat-to-conv-execution-E01.md'

> no do not: create the fully expanded version with ALL 
prompt content included. You do not have enough context 
tokens. Instead write a specification for exactly how to
 do it so the next agent can execute. Put the spec with 
work done so far, and how to complete the prompt 
templates content. Put the prompt templates content

     # Prompt Templates Content Expansion Specification

     **Purpose**: Specification for completing the full
     expansion of
     `04-cat-to-conv-templates-execution-E01_v2.md`
     **Status**: Partial - Prompt 0 complete, Prompts
     1-3 need full expansion

  📋 What This Spec Contains:

  1. Current Status

  - ✅ What's been completed (Prompt 0 - full SAOL
  schema setup)
  - 🔨 What needs work (Prompts 1-3 expansion)

  2. Detailed Expansion Instructions

  - Step 1: Extract Prompt 1 content (source lines
  433-978, ~546 lines)
  - Step 2: Extract Prompt 2 content (source lines
  982-1364, ~383 lines)
  - Step 3: Extract Prompt 3 content (source lines
  1367-1645, ~279 lines)
  - Step 4: Insert into v2 file replacing placeholders

  3. Exact Line Numbers

  - Source file locations precisely specified
  - Target file replacement locations identified
  - Content length estimates provided

  4. Verification Steps

  - File structure check (should be ~1850-1900 lines)
  - Prompt delimiter count (4 of each)
  - Content completeness checks (grep commands)
  - No placeholder text remaining check

  5. Execution Prompt

  Ready-to-use prompt for the next agent to execute the
  work.

  🎯 Summary of Your Request

  You were absolutely correct to:
  1. ✅ Stop me from creating the full expansion (would
  have exceeded context limits)
  2. ✅ Request a specification instead
  3. ✅ Specify the exact location for the spec document

  The specification is now ready for another agent to
  execute the expansion work when you have the context
  budget available.

> so in what order should I execute these specs? 1. Prompt Engine 
spec | 2. Templates Execution V2 | storage spec\
is this good? don't elaborate just give me the short answer 

● Correct order:

  1. Prompt Engine spec (complete the v2 file expansion)
  2. Templates Execution V2 (implement database + templates)
  3. Storage spec (implement conversation storage)

  Yes, this is correct.

> you said: "Prompt Engine spec" (complete the v2 file expansion) is       
that : `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\train-data\pmc\product\_ma    
pping\unique\cat-to-conv-P01\04-cat-to-conv-templates-engine-prompts-sp    
ec_v1.md`? short answer 

● Yes, that's correct.



File Structure:

  - Lines: 855 (condensed with placeholders for Prompts 1-3 to avoid       
  repetition)
  - Location: C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\train-data\pmc\product\_m
  apping\unique\cat-to-conv-P01\04-cat-to-conv-templates-execution-E01_v2.md

  Note: I created a condensed version with placeholders for the unchanged  
  Prompts 1-3 content. If you need the FULL expanded version with all prompt
   content included, I can generate that. The current version includes:    
  - ✅ Complete Prompt 0 (new, 500+ lines)
  - 📝 Prompt 1 reference (says "content stays same as original")
  - 📝 Prompt 2 reference (says "content stays same as original")
  - 📝 Prompt 3 reference (says "content stays same as original")

  Would you like me to create the fully expanded version with ALL prompt   
  content included?
