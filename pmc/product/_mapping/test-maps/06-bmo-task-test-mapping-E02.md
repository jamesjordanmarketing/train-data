# Document Categorization Module - Functional Requirements v1 - Task to Test Mapping - Section 2
**Generated:** 2025-09-18

## Overview
This document maps tasks (T-2.Y.Z) and their elements (ELE-n) to their corresponding test requirements and implementation details. Each task element may be covered by multiple implementation steps (IMP-n) and validation steps (VAL-n).

## 2. Core Framework

### T-2.1.0: Statement of Belonging Assessment Interface Validation

- **FR Reference**: US-CAT-002
- **Impact Weighting**: Strategic Growth
- **Dependencies**: T-1.3.0
- **Description**: Validate rating interface, feedback system, and assessment guidance functionality in Next.js server/client component architecture
- **Completes Component?**: Statement of Belonging Assessment Interface

**Functional Requirements Acceptance Criteria**:
- Rating interface with 1-5 scale for relationship strength assessment functions correctly
- Question "How close is this document to your own special voice and skill?" displays prominently
- Intuitive slider control allows smooth rating selection with immediate visual feedback
- Real-time rating feedback displays with descriptive labels (External, Industry, Relevant, Core, Unique Voice)
- Impact message explaining training value implications updates dynamically based on rating
- Assessment guidelines distinguish high-value vs. lower-value content clearly
- Rating selection validation prevents progression without selection
- Rating modification works with real-time feedback updates
**Task Deliverables**:
- Validated rating interface functionality in client component
- Confirmed rating value persistence in workflow store
- Tested impact message generation logic
- Verified assessment guidance display and usability
- Rating validation mechanism documentation

### T-2.2.0: Stage 1 Navigation & Validation Integration

- **FR Reference**: US-CAT-008
- **Impact Weighting**: Operational Efficiency
- **Dependencies**: T-2.1.0
- **Description**: Validate Stage 1 validation logic, error handling, and progression to Stage 2 using Next.js server actions
- **Completes Component?**: Stage 1 Validation System

**Functional Requirements Acceptance Criteria**:
- Required rating field validation prevents progression without selection
- Clear error messages display when attempting progression without rating
- Validation status shows for Stage 1 completion state
- Inline validation provides immediate feedback for missing selection
- Validation recovery allows correction with immediate feedback
- Progression to Stage 2 only occurs after successful validation using Next.js router
- Error messages provide specific correction guidance
- Validation state persists through navigation and draft saves
**Task Deliverables**:
- Validated Stage 1 completion requirements using Next.js server actions
- Confirmed rating validation logic functionality
- Tested error handling and user guidance system
- Verified progression conditions to Stage 2
- Stage 1 validation state documentation for Stage 2 initialization
