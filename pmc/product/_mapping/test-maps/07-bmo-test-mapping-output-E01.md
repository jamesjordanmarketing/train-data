- Ensure stage indicators (1, 2, 3) show current position and completion status correctly
- Complete stage completion checkmarks that appear and persist through navigation
- Implement forward/backward navigation with proper validation enforcement using Next.js router
- Ensure data persistence maintained across stage navigation without data loss
- Implement overall workflow status and completion indicators with accurate display
- Complete stage-specific validation that prevents progression with incomplete data
- Implement exit/save draft functionality with confirmation dialogs and state preservation

#### Test Requirements
- Verify progress bar calculates and displays correct completion percentage for each workflow stage
- Validate stage indicators accurately reflect current position and completion states
- Test stage completion checkmarks appear correctly and persist across navigation events
- Ensure forward navigation enforces validation rules and prevents invalid progression
- Verify backward navigation maintains data integrity and allows proper workflow resumption
- Test data persistence mechanisms maintain all user input across stage transitions
- Validate stage-specific validation logic prevents progression with missing required data
- Test exit/save draft functionality triggers appropriate confirmation dialogs
- Verify Next.js router integration handles workflow navigation correctly with proper URL states
- Test workflow state recovery after browser refresh or session interruption

#### Testing Deliverables
- `progress-tracking.test.ts`: Tests for progress bar calculation and display logic
- `stage-indicators.test.ts`: Tests for stage indicator states and visual feedback
