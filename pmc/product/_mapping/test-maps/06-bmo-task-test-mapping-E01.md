# Document Categorization Module - Functional Requirements v1 - Task to Test Mapping - Section 1
**Generated:** 2025-09-18

## Overview
This document maps tasks (T-1.Y.Z) and their elements (ELE-n) to their corresponding test requirements and implementation details. Each task element may be covered by multiple implementation steps (IMP-n) and validation steps (VAL-n).

## 1. Project Foundation

### T-1.1.0: Document Selection & Workflow Initiation Validation

- **FR Reference**: US-CAT-001
- **Impact Weighting**: Operational Efficiency
- **Dependencies**: None
- **Description**: Validate document selection interface and workflow initiation functionality
- **Completes Component?**: Document Selection Interface

**Functional Requirements Acceptance Criteria**:
- Display list of available documents with titles and content previews functioning correctly
- Single document selection from available options works without errors
- Workflow initiation upon document selection transitions to Stage 1 properly (Next.js app router navigation)
- Document information displays throughout workflow with persistent context
- Clear indication of workflow start and document context is visible to users
**Task Deliverables**:
- Validated document selection interface state in server and client components
- Confirmed workflow store initialization data structure
- Tested document context persistence mechanism
- Verified navigation to Stage 1 with selected document data using Next.js router

### T-1.2.0: Workflow Progress & Navigation System Validation

- **FR Reference**: US-CAT-005
- **Impact Weighting**: Operational Efficiency
- **Dependencies**: T-1.1.0
- **Description**: Validate progress tracking, navigation controls, and step completion indicators across Next.js app router
- **Completes Component?**: Workflow Navigation System

**Functional Requirements Acceptance Criteria**:
- Progress bar showing completion percentage across all stages functions correctly
- Stage indicators (1, 2, 3) display current position and completion status accurately
- Stage completion checkmarks appear and persist through navigation
- Forward/backward navigation works with proper validation enforcement using Next.js router
- Data persistence maintained across stage navigation without loss
- Overall workflow status and completion indicators display correctly
- Stage-specific validation prevents progression with incomplete data
- Exit/save draft functionality works with confirmation dialogs
**Task Deliverables**:
- Validated progress tracking system state
- Confirmed navigation control mechanisms using Next.js app router
- Tested stage completion validation logic
- Verified workflow persistence across browser sessions
- Progress indicator accuracy documentation

### T-1.3.0: Draft Management & Data Persistence Validation

- **FR Reference**: US-CAT-007
- **Impact Weighting**: Operational Efficiency
- **Dependencies**: T-1.2.0
- **Description**: Validate auto-save, manual save, and workflow resumption functionality using Next.js server actions
- **Completes Component?**: Draft Management System

**Functional Requirements Acceptance Criteria**:
- Auto-save categorization progress occurs at regular intervals without user intervention
- Manual "Save Draft" functionality provides confirmation and saves all current state using Next.js server actions
- All selections and progress persist across browser sessions and page refreshes
- Workflow resumption from saved state restores exact previous position
- Save status indicators display throughout workflow with accurate timestamps
- Data integrity maintained during stage navigation and exit/resume cycles
- Draft save timestamps and last modified information display correctly
- Workflow exit with saved draft state preserves all user input
**Task Deliverables**:
- Validated data persistence mechanisms using Next.js server actions
- Confirmed auto-save trigger points and intervals
- Tested browser session restoration functionality
- Verified data integrity across persistence cycles
- Save state indicator validation documentation
