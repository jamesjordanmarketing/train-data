# Document Categorization Module
Version: 4.0

## Product Summary

This task execution plan transforms the Document Categorization Module functional requirements into specific, actionable tasks that validate and enhance the existing wireframe implementation in `4-categories-wf\`. Each task includes explicit deliverables and prerequisites to maintain workflow continuity and ensure comprehensive validation of the categorization system.

**Key Constraint:** This plan focuses on validating and enhancing the existing wireframe implementation rather than building from scratch. All tasks must contribute directly to confirming the 3-step categorization workflow functions correctly and saves data to Supabase.

## Role and Context
You are a senior Software Test Engineer with extensive experience in test-driven development for modern web applications. Your expertise includes unit testing, component testing, integration testing, accessibility validation, and visual regression testing. Your role is to generate comprehensive test planning and verification content for each task, including:

1. Task-specific acceptance criteria
2. Estimated human testing hours
3. Appropriate testing tools
4. Test requirements
5. Testing deliverables
6. Human verification items

## Objective
Your objective is to create a clear, non-duplicative test mapping structure that establishes direct traceability between parent task acceptance criteria and test verification. For each task you will:

1. **Extract Acceptance Criteria**: Identify criteria from parent tasks that apply to each child task
2. **Estimate Testing Effort**: Provide time estimates for human testing activities
3. **Specify Testing Tools**: Recommend appropriate testing tools for each task's technology
4. **Define Test Requirements**: Create specific test requirements that validate acceptance criteria
5. **Detail Testing Deliverables**: Specify concrete test artifacts to be created
6. **Identify Manual Verification Needs**: Highlight aspects requiring human judgment

When complete, remove all placeholder text. All writing operations will operate inline here (the same file as the input: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\BRun\brun3a\pmc\product\_mapping\test-maps\07-bmo-test-mapping-E01.md`)

## Task Range
For each execution, you will be given a specific task range to process (e.g., "T-1.1.1 - T-2.5.5"). You should only process tasks within this range and ignore any tasks outside of it.

**Current Task Range**: T-1.1.0 - T-1.3.0

## Analysis Requirements

### 1. Acceptance Criteria Extraction
For each child task (T-X.Y.Z where Z is not 0), extract relevant acceptance criteria from the parent task's "Functional Requirements Acceptance Criteria" section:

1. Identify criteria in the parent task (T-X.Y.0) that are directly relevant to this child task
2. Reformulate these criteria to be specific and testable at the child task level
3. Ensure criteria align with the specific elements (ELE-n) being implemented
4. Add any implicit criteria derived from the element descriptions and implementation steps

Format:
```markdown
#### Acceptance Criteria
- Implement [specific capability] with [specific quality/constraint]
- Ensure [specific feature] conforms to [specific standard/requirement]
- Complete [specific deliverable] with [specific characteristics]
```

### 2. Estimated Human Testing Hours
Provide an expert estimate of the hours required for a human tester to perform all testing activities for this task:

1. Consider complexity of the elements being tested
2. Account for both automated test creation and manual verification time
3. Include time for test planning, execution, and documentation
4. Provide a realistic range based on testing complexity

For each task, provide:
```markdown
- **Estimated Human Testing Hours**: [X-Y] hours
```

Estimation guidelines:
- Simple tasks (1-2 elements, minimal validation): 2-4 hours
- Moderate tasks (2-3 elements, standard validation): 4-8 hours
- Complex tasks (multiple elements, complex validation): 8-16 hours
- Very complex tasks (system-level, multiple integrations): 16-24 hours

### 3. Testing Tools Specification
Recommend specific testing tools appropriate for each task based on:

1. The technology being implemented (UI components, server functions, etc.)
2. The type of testing required (unit, integration, accessibility, etc.)
3. The specific verification needs of the element

While Jest/TypeScript is the standard foundation, specify additional tools where appropriate:

```markdown
- **Testing Tools**: Jest, TypeScript, [additional specific tools as needed]
```

Common tool recommendations:
- UI components: React Testing Library, Storybook, Chromatic
- Visual testing: Percy, Playwright Visual Comparisons
- Accessibility: Axe, Pa11y
- API testing: Supertest, MSW (Mock Service Worker)
- Performance: Lighthouse, Web Vitals
- End-to-end: Playwright, Cypress

### 4. Test Requirements Derivation
Generate 3-5 specific test requirements for each element based on:
- The extracted acceptance criteria for this task
- The validation steps listed for the element
- The implementation steps for the element
- The element's purpose and name

Each test requirement should:
- Be specific and testable
- Link clearly to one or more acceptance criteria
- Focus on a particular aspect of functionality
- Include expected inputs and outputs when appropriate

Format:
```markdown
- **Test Requirements**:
  - Verify [specific functionality] with [specific inputs/conditions]
  - Validate [specific outcome/behavior] when [specific scenario]
  - Test [edge case/boundary condition]
  - Ensure [performance/security/accessibility aspect]
```

### 5. Testing Deliverables Specification
Specify 2-4 concrete testing deliverables for each element, such as:
- Specific test files to be created
- Test suites with particular test cases
- Mock implementations needed
- Test fixtures required
- Coverage reports expected

Each deliverable should:
- Have a clear name (usually a filename)
- Include a brief description of what it tests
- Follow naming conventions for test files
- Focus on specific aspects of the element

Format:
```markdown
- **Testing Deliverables**:
  - `[filename].test.ts`: Tests for [specific functionality]
  - `[mock-name].mock.ts`: Mock implementation for [specific component/service]
  - Test fixture for [specific scenario]
  - Integration test suite for [specific interaction]
```

### 6. Human Verification Items
Identify 2-3 aspects that require human verification for each element, such as:
- Visual appearance and layout
- Animation behavior and timing
- Design consistency
- Responsive behavior across devices
- Accessibility aspects requiring judgment
- Performance aspects requiring subjective evaluation

Each verification item should:
- Be specific about what to verify
- Include clear success criteria
- Specify conditions under which to verify
- Explain why it requires human judgment

Format:
```markdown
- **Human Verification Items**:
  - Visually verify [specific UI element] maintains [specific design quality] across [specific device/viewport sizes]
  - Confirm [specific animation/transition] feels smooth and natural
  - Validate that [specific interaction] aligns with design system principles
```

## Additional Guidelines

1. **Avoid Duplication**: Do not repeat information between sections. Each section should serve a specific purpose without redundancy.

2. **Establish Traceability**: Ensure test requirements clearly connect to acceptance criteria.

3. **Technology-Specific Testing**: Recommend testing approaches appropriate for:
   - TypeScript: Type safety, strict null checks, interface compliance
   - Next.js 14: Server components, client boundaries, App Router conventions
   - React: Component rendering, hooks behavior, state management
   - UI Components: Visual consistency, responsive behavior, accessibility

4. **Testing Approach By Component Type**:
   - Server Components: Server-side rendering, data fetching, caching
   - Client Components: Hydration, interactive behavior, event handling
   - Layout Components: Composition, nesting, responsive behavior
   - Form Components: Validation, submission, error states
   - Data Components: Fetching, loading states, error handling

5. **Accessibility Considerations**: Always include testing for:
   - Keyboard navigation
   - Screen reader compatibility
   - Color contrast compliance
   - Focus indication
   - ARIA attributes

Remember to focus exclusively on generating quality test planning and verification content for the specified task range only. Do not modify any other parts of the document.
