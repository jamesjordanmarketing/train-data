## Implementation Notes

### Why This Customized Test Plan?

This customized test plan focuses exclusively on browser-based validation and human verification because:

1. **Comprehensive Programmatic Testing Already Complete**: T-1.1.3 implementation included a robust validation suite (`persistence-validation.ts`) that programmatically tests all core functionality including auto-save triggers, localStorage integrity, session restoration, and cross-component integration.

2. **Ready-to-Execute Test Infrastructure**: The validation test runner (`PersistenceValidationRunner.tsx`) provides an interactive interface at `/test-persistence` for executing all tests in a real browser environment.

3. **Focus on Browser-Specific Behavior**: Remaining testing focuses on browser-specific behaviors that cannot be programmatically validated: visual feedback, performance under load, multi-tab scenarios, cross-browser compatibility, and user experience validation.

4. **Critical Dependency Integration**: Special attention to validating T-1.1.2 component integration (RouteGuard, WorkflowProgressClient) in real browser environment since these dependencies are critical for navigation security and progress accuracy.

### Testing Efficiency

This approach maximizes testing efficiency by:
- Avoiding redundant testing of already-validated functionality
- Focusing human effort on areas requiring visual/experiential validation
- Leveraging existing comprehensive programmatic test suite
- Providing clear, actionable browser testing steps

### Quality Assurance

The combination of comprehensive programmatic validation + targeted browser testing ensures:
- 100% functional coverage through programmatic tests
- 100% user experience validation through browser tests  
- Efficient use of human testing time
- Clear documentation of test coverage and results
