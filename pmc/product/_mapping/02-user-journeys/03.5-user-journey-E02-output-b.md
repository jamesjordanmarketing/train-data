## Stage 2 Executive Summary

### Stage 2 Purpose and Objectives
Stage 2 transforms raw knowledge assets into clean, processed content ready for AI analysis. This stage bridges the gap between unstructured user content (documents, files, various formats) and organized knowledge that can be explored and transformed into training data. The primary objective is to handle technical complexity transparently while maintaining user confidence and engagement throughout the processing workflow.

### Primary User Personas for Stage 2
**Content Creator (Primary)**: Daily platform user who needs efficient, reliable content ingestion with minimal friction and maximum confidence in processing quality. They bring diverse file formats and expect professional-grade document handling without technical expertise requirements.

**Domain Expert (Secondary)**: Subject matter expert who uploads valuable knowledge assets and needs assurance that content integrity and meaning are preserved during processing. They require transparency and control over how their expertise is interpreted and organized.

### Stage 2 Scope and Boundaries
Stage 2 encompasses all activities from initial content upload through final document organization. It includes file handling, content extraction, automated cleaning, processing transparency, and intelligent categorization. It does NOT include knowledge analysis, insight generation, or training data creation - those belong to Stage 3.

### Stage 2 Success Definition
Success is achieved when users can upload diverse content formats, see transparent processing progress, receive clean organized content, and feel confident that their valuable knowledge has been accurately captured and prepared for the next stage. The stage must deliver 100% successful upload rate with <2 minutes processing per document.

### Value Delivered by Stage 2
Eliminates technical barriers to content ingestion, provides professional-grade document processing without technical expertise requirements, builds user confidence through transparency, and creates organized foundation for knowledge exploration.
