# Enhanced User Journey Document Generation Prompt Template (v9) â€” Stage-Specific with Hybrid Acceptance Criteria

## Core Objective
Generate comprehensive stage-specific user journey documentation that provides granular acceptance criteria enabling direct functional requirements derivation. PRIMARY FOCUS: Create detailed, testable acceptance criteria using hybrid approach (user experience + technical requirements) that development teams can implement directly.

## PRIMARY FOCUS: Enhanced Acceptance Criteria Generation

### Hybrid Acceptance Criteria Approach (REQUIRED)
For each stage element, provide BOTH user experience and technical acceptance criteria:

```markdown
* User Journey Acceptance Criteria (Experience Focus):
  - GIVEN: [User context from user perspective]
  - WHEN: [User action or trigger]
  - THEN: [Expected user experience/outcome]
  - AND: [Additional user experience outcomes]
  - AND: [Additional user experience outcomes]
  [Continue with 5-8+ detailed AND clauses]

* Technical Acceptance Criteria (Implementation Focus):
  - [Specific technical requirement 1 with measurable criteria]
  - [Specific technical requirement 2 with performance benchmarks]
  - [Specific technical requirement 3 with quality thresholds]
  - [Additional technical requirements as needed]
```

### User Stories Integration (REQUIRED)
For each UJ element, extract and incorporate specific details from corresponding user stories:
- Identify exact US5.x.x user stories that map to each UJ element
- Incorporate specific interface requirements from user stories
- Include business context and domain-specific requirements
- Preserve technical implementation specifics from acceptance criteria
- Maintain user experience focus while adding technical depth

### Granularity Requirements (Enhanced)
Each acceptance criterion must be:
- **Specific**: No ambiguity about success criteria with measurable thresholds
