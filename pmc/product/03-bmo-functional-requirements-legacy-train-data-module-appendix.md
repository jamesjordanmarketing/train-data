# Training Data Module - Prompts 3, 4, and Conclusion

## APPEND THIS TO THE MAIN FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENT

### PROMPT 3: Conversation Generation with Claude API

**Note:** For brevity in the main document, PROMPT 3 implementation details are based on the User Stories (US-TRAIN-003, US-TRAIN-004, US-TRAIN-005) and Technical Requirements already specified.

#### Key Implementation Components:

1. **Claude API Service** - Integrate Anthropic SDK for conversation generation
2. **Generation Orchestrator** - Manage single, batch, and "process all" workflows
3. **Progress Tracking** - Real-time updates via Supabase subscriptions
4. **Quality Validation** - Automatic quality metrics calculation

### PROMPT 4: Conversation Planning and Template System

=========================



```
You are implementing the final component of the Training Data Generation Module. This is PROMPT 4 of 4.

## Task: Populate Conversation Planning Data and Templates

### Step 1: Create Conversation Planning Data

Create specifications for all 100 conversations:

**Conversations 1-10:** Seed conversations (already in database)
**Conversations 11-50:** Tier 1 Template-driven (40 conversations, 5 templates × 8 each)
**Conversations 51-85:** Tier 2 Scenario-based (35 conversations)
**Conversations 86-100:** Tier 3 Edge cases (15 conversations)

### Step 2: Build Template System

Create generation templates for each tier with:
- Complete system instructions
- Persona integration
- Emotional arc guidance
- JSON output format specification
- Quality requirements

### Step 3: Populate Database

Run scripts to insert:
- 90 conversation specifications (conversations 11-100)
- All tier templates
- Reference mappings

### Step 4: End-to-End Testing

Test complete workflow:
- Single conversation generation
- Batch processing
- Quality metrics
- UI functionality

### Deliverables:

✅ 100 total conversations in database (10 seed + 90 planned)
✅ Complete template system for three tiers
✅ Tested generation pipeline
✅ Quality validation working
✅ Production-ready system
```

## Document Summary and Implementation Guide

### Overview

This functional requirements document provides complete specifications for the **Training Data Generation Module** - a system to generate, manage, and validate 100 high-quality LoRA training conversations.

### Four-Prompt Implementation Sequence

**PROMPT 1: Database Setup** (2-3 hours)
- Execute SQL migration (8 tables)
- Import 10 seed conversations from JSON
- Create database service layer
- Verify data integrity

**PROMPT 2: User Interface** (3-4 hours)
- Build conversation matrix table
- Implement multi-dimensional filtering
- Create conversation detail view
- Add progress tracking UI

**PROMPT 3: Generation Engine** (4-5 hours)
- Integrate Claude API
- Build generation orchestrator
- Implement single/batch/process-all
- Add real-time progress updates

**PROMPT 4: Planning Data** (2-3 hours)
- Populate 90 conversation specifications
- Create three-tier template system
- Test end-to-end workflow
- Validate quality metrics

**Total Development Time:** 12-16 hours

### Key Features Delivered

1. **Database Infrastructure:**
   - 8 normalized tables with relationships
   - 10 seed conversations with complete annotation
   - 90 conversation specifications ready for generation
   - Quality metrics and validation tracking

2. **User Interface:**
   - Filterable conversation matrix (persona, tier, emotion, topic, status)
   - Detailed conversation view with tabs
   - Real-time generation progress
   - Quality dashboard with metrics

3. **Generation System:**
   - Claude 4.5 Sonnet API integration
   - Template-based generation (three tiers)
   - Single, batch, and "process all" modes
   - Cost tracking and usage monitoring
   - Automatic quality calculation

4. **Data Quality:**
   - Complete emotional context analysis (30-50 indicators per turn)
   - Response strategy documentation
   - Sentence-by-sentence breakdowns (3-6 word rationales each)
   - Multi-dimensional quality scoring

### Production Deployment

After implementation, follow these steps:

1. **Configure Environment:**
   ```bash
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_api_key
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
   ```

2. **Execute Prompts Sequentially:**
   - Run PROMPT 1 → Verify database created
   - Run PROMPT 2 → Test UI functionality
   - Run PROMPT 3 → Test single generation
   - Run PROMPT 4 → Test complete workflow

3. **Generate Training Data:**
   - Start with Tier 1 (40 conversations)
   - Review quality, adjust templates if needed
   - Generate Tier 2 and Tier 3
   - Review and approve all conversations

4. **Export for Training:**
   - Export approved conversations as JSON
   - Prepare dataset for LoRA fine-tuning
   - Document statistics and metadata

### Success Metrics

- **100 conversations** generated with complete annotation
- **Average quality score:** ≥ 4.5/5.0
- **Completeness:** 100% of required fields populated
- **Ready for training:** All conversations approved
- **Cost efficiency:** <$0.30 per conversation average
- **Generation time:** 2-5 minutes per conversation

### Future Enhancements

- Variation generation (10-25 per seed conversation)
- Collaborative review workflows
- Advanced analytics dashboard
- Integration with training platforms
- A/B testing for template optimization
- Multi-language support
