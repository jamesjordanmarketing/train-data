### Quality Criteria Validation
Each functional requirement must include:
1. Minimum 8 detailed acceptance criteria
2. At least 3 codebase references (where applicable)
3. Specific data types, constraints, and validation rules
4. Error handling and edge case considerations
5. Performance expectations (timeouts, limits, thresholds)
