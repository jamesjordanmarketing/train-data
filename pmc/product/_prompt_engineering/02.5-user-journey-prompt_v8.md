# User Journey Document Generation Prompt

## Objective
Generate a comprehensive user journey document that maps the complete user experience through progressive stages, providing granular acceptance criteria that enable a future prompt to create precise functional requirements for the Bright Run platform.

## Required Inputs
- **Template:** `pmc\product\_templates\03-functional-requirements-template.md`
  - Defines the required format, structure, and numbering conventions for organizing the user journey document.
- **Example:** `pmc\product\_examples\03-bmo-functional-requirements.md`  
  - Provides a reference for structure, depth, quality expectations, and organizational formatting.

## Bright Run Context Requirements

### Non-Technical User Focus
- Interface terminology must be understandable by intelligent non-technical users (smart 10th grader with AI basics)
- Tooltips and contextual help explain AI concepts in simple terms
- Visual cues and progress indicators reduce cognitive load
- Error messages provide clear, actionable guidance without technical jargon

### Internal MVP Constraints
- NO user authentication, settings, data isolation, or encryption features
- NO infrastructure items not directly relevant to core functionality
- ONLY features that directly contribute to LoRA training data generation
- Focus on proof-of-concept demonstration, not enterprise deployment

### Quality & Performance Standards
- 95%+ approval rates for generated training pairs
- 10-100x multiplication of expert examples through synthetic generation
- Sub-2-hour completion time for first knowledge project
- Voice consistency preservation across all generated variations

## Document Structure Requirements

### User Journey Organization Using FR Structure
Organize the user journey into sections using the FR#.#.# numbering system for clarity:
- **Section 1**: Discovery & Project Initialization (UJ1.x.x)
- **Section 2**: Content Ingestion & Automated Processing (UJ2.x.x)  
- **Section 3**: Knowledge Exploration & Intelligent Organization (UJ3.x.x)
- **Section 4**: Training Data Generation & Expert Customization (UJ4.x.x)
- **Section 5**: Collaborative Quality Control & Final Validation (UJ5.x.x)
- **Section 6**: Synthetic Data Expansion & Value Amplification (UJ6.x.x)

### 1. Journey Architecture
Create a user journey that:
- Progresses through **clearly defined stages** from initial contact to final outcome
- Builds incrementally where each stage enables the next
- Identifies **multiple user personas** that may interact at different stages
- Maps both **happy path** and **edge cases** for each stage
- Delivers demonstrable user value at each stage completion
- Creates a compelling proof-of-concept progression

### 2. Stage Definition Format
For each journey stage, provide:

```
STAGE [#]: [Stage Name]
Purpose: [Core objective of this stage]
User Persona(s): [Primary and secondary users involved]
Entry Criteria: [Prerequisites that must be met to enter this stage]
Exit Criteria: [Conditions that must be satisfied to complete this stage]
Success Metrics: [Measurable indicators of successful completion]
User Value Delivered: [Specific benefit users receive upon stage completion]
Proof-of-Concept Demonstration: [How this stage proves the product concept]
```

### 3. Detailed User Actions
Within each stage, document:
- **User Goals**: What the user is trying to achieve
- **User Actions**: Step-by-step actions the user takes
- **System Responses**: How the system reacts to each action
- **Decision Points**: Where users must make choices
- **Touchpoints**: Specific UI elements or system interfaces involved
- **User Journey Flow**: Complete experience progression through the stage

### 4. Enhanced Acceptance Criteria Format
For each user action or feature within a stage, provide acceptance criteria using structured format:

```
UJ[Section#].[Subsection#].[Item#]: [User Journey Element Title]
* Description: [Clear description of what the user experiences]
* Impact Weighting: [Revenue Impact / Strategic Growth / Operational Efficiency]
* Priority: [High/Medium/Low]
* User Stories: [Reference to related user stories]
* Tasks: [Placeholder for task references]
* User Journey Acceptance Criteria:
  - GIVEN: [Initial context/state from user perspective]
  - WHEN: [User action or trigger]
  - THEN: [Expected system behavior/outcome from user perspective]
  - AND: [Additional outcomes if applicable]

Technical Notes: [Any technical dependencies or constraints]
Data Requirements: [Specific data elements needed]
Error Scenarios: [What happens when things go wrong from user perspective]
Performance Criteria: [Response times, load handling, etc.]
User Experience Notes: [Non-technical user considerations]
```

### 5. Cross-Stage Dependencies & Progressive Value Building
Document relationships between stages:
- **Data Flow**: What information passes between stages
- **State Management**: What must be preserved across stages
- **Progressive Enhancement**: How capabilities build upon previous stages
- **Foundation Elements**: What each stage establishes for future stages
- **Value Amplification**: How stages enhance previous stage outcomes
- **Rollback Scenarios**: How users can return to previous stages if needed

## Content Generation Guidelines

### User-Centric Language
- Write from the user's perspective using "I want to..." or "I need to..."
- Use terminology that aligns with non-technical users (understandable by a smart 10th grader who knows AI basics)
- Include emotional states and motivations where relevant
- Avoid technical jargon in user-facing descriptions
- Ensure tooltips and contextual help explain AI concepts in simple terms

### Granularity Requirements
Each acceptance criterion must be:
- **Specific**: No ambiguity about what constitutes success
- **Measurable**: Include concrete values, thresholds, or states
- **Testable**: A QA engineer should be able to write a test case from it
- **Independent**: Can be validated without depending on other criteria
- **Relevant**: Directly supports the user's goal for that stage
- **Non-Technical User Friendly**: Considers cognitive load and user experience

### Progressive Complexity & Stage Organization
- Start with the simplest viable interaction that delivers immediate value
- Add complexity only when previous stages are complete
- Ensure each stage delivers value independently
- Support iterative development and testing
- Build user confidence and engagement through early stages
- Maintain user momentum through middle stages
- Deliver maximum sophistication in later stages

## Required Sections

### 1. Executive Summary
- Product vision alignment with Bright Run objectives
- Key user personas overview
- Journey scope and boundaries
- Success definition aligned with quality standards
- Value progression story for proof-of-concept

### 3. Journey Stages Organized by Section
Structure user journey stages to optimize both user experience and development efficiency:
- **Section 1: Discovery & Project Initialization** (immediate value, minimal investment)
- **Section 2: Content Ingestion & Automated Processing** (foundation building)
- **Section 3: Knowledge Exploration & Intelligent Organization** (main workflow, proof-of-concept core)
- **Section 4: Training Data Generation & Expert Customization** (quality assurance)
- **Section 5: Collaborative Quality Control & Final Validation** (value delivery)
- **Section 6: Synthetic Data Expansion & Value Amplification** (sophisticated capabilities)

### 4. Acceptance Criteria Inventory
