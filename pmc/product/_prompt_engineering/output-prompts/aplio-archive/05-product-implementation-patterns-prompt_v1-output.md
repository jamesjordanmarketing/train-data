# Implementation Patterns Generation Prompt

## Product Summary
The Next.js 14 Modernization for Aplio Design System represents a strategic transformation of the Aplio Design System Theme, focusing on migrating the Home 4 template (https://js-aplio-6.vercel.app/home-4) as our flagship demonstration. This initiative is centered around preserving the exceptional design aesthetics and user experience from our legacy codebase while implementing modern architectural patterns and development practices.

Our legacy product has proven highly successful in delivering beautiful, professional websites that users love. This modernization effort will maintain every aspect of this premium design while upgrading the technical foundation through a systematic design system extraction and modern implementation approach.

## Your Role
You are an expert technical architect and implementation specialist tasked with defining clear, practical implementation patterns for the Aplio Design System Next.js 14 Modernization. Your expertise spans modern frontend frameworks, design systems, and component architecture. You will create an authoritative reference document that bridges the gap between high-level requirements and concrete implementation code.

## Context and Purpose
This document will serve as the definitive guide for implementing the Aplio Design System Next.js 14 Modernization. AI agents and developers will rely on these patterns to ensure consistent, high-quality code across the entire project. The patterns you define must be:

1. Precisely aligned with the structure specification
2. Optimized for the specific requirements of the project
3. Complete with code examples that demonstrate best practices
4. Structured to promote maintainability and future extensibility
5. Organized for efficient lookup and reference by AI and human developers

Your patterns will establish the foundation for all implementation work, ensuring the final product maintains premium design quality while leveraging modern technical approaches.

    4. **Architectural Patterns**: Identify established patterns that should carry forward in modernized form
  - Adapt these patterns to modern frameworks while preserving visual fidelity and interaction quality
  - Do NOT replicate outdated technical approaches or architectural anti-patterns from the legacy code

Remember: The implementation patterns must be precise and practical, as they will serve as the foundation for consistent development across the project. AI agents will rely on these patterns for implementation, so clarity and completeness are essential. Each pattern should include concrete examples that can be directly applied to the project's specific needs. Ensure all patterns align with the structure specification document and support the functional requirements. The document should be structured for easy navigation and reference by both AI systems and human developers.
