# Functional Requirements with Wireframe Enhancement Prompt

## Product Summary
Bright Run is a comprehensive LoRA fine-tuning training data platform that transforms an organization's raw, unstructured knowledge into proprietary LoRA-ready training datasets through an intuitive workflow. The module we are developing now is the Bright Run Training Data Generation Module also known as the "train-data" module.

**One-Sentence Summary:**  
The Bright Run Training Data Generation Module transforms the manual, console-based process of creating LoRA training conversations into an intuitive, UI-driven workflow that enables non-technical users to generate, review, and manage high-quality conversation datasets through intelligent prompt templates, dimensional filtering, and real-time progress tracking.

## **Module Vision: The Conversation Generation Engine**

The Training Data Generation Module receives seed questions derived from and chunked documents from the previous pipeline stages and enables users to generate synthetic conversation training data at scale through an interactive web interface. This replaces the current manual console-based approach where users must copy, paste, and execute JSON prompts individually.

The key insight: generating high-quality training conversations requires control, visibility, and flexibilityâ€”not just automation. Users need to select, filter, generate, and review conversations individually or in batches, with full transparency into the generation process.

## CRITICAL RULES FOR DOCUMENT HANDLING

1. **Document Completeness**
   - You MUST process the ENTIRE `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\BRun\train-data\pmc\product\03-train-functional-requirements-before-wireframe.md` document from start to finish
   - You MUST maintain the existing section numbering scheme

2. **Enhancement Approach**
   - Start with the existing document at `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\BRun\train-data\pmc\product\03-train-functional-requirements-before-wireframe.md`
   - For each section:
     a. Enhance existing requirements with more detail
     b. Add new sections & requirements where gaps are identified
     c. Ensure consistent depth across all requirements
     d. Do not create duplicate requirements or sections

3. **Validation Requirements**
   - Each requirement must be as detailed as the most detailed existing requirement
   - New requirements must match or exceed the detail level of existing ones
   - All sections must be processed, with no truncation

## File Handling Instructions

### 1. Input/Output File Handling
1. File Specification:
   - Input file: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\BRun\train-data\pmc\product\03-train-functional-requirements-before-wireframe.md`       
   - You MUST process the ENTIRE `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\BRun\train-data\pmc\product\03-train-functional-requirements-before-wireframe.md` document from start to finish
   - Output file: Write the new version of the functional requirements file to: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\BRun\train-data\pmc\product\03-train-functional-requirements-integrate-wireframe_v1.md`
   - Generate a complete updated version of the entire document
   - Maintain the existing markdown format 

2. Processing Requirements:
   - Read through all existing functional requirements in the file before starting any work
   - Process requirements in place, maintaining the original file structure
   - Add new requirements under appropriate sections
   - Maintain consistent level of detail across all requirements
   - ENSURE ALL SECTIONS ARE PROCESSED TO COMPLETION

### 2. Sequential Processing
1. Process requirements in sequential order through ALL sections
2. Maintain requirement hierarchy in the file structure
3. Follow the template structure from `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\BRun\train-data\pmc\product\03-bmo-functional-requirements.md`
4. Track progress through sections to ensure completion

### 3. File Update Process
1. Read the current content of `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\BRun\train-data\pmc\product\03-train-functional-requirements-before-wireframe.md`
2. Process one section at a time
3. For each section:
   b. Enhance existing requirements when it will result in a better train data module
   c. Add new requirements when it will result in a better train data module
   d. Validate completeness
4. Continue until ALL sections are processed
5. Verify no sections were truncated or skipped

## Required Inputs

### 1. Read the foundational documentations for this project:
The product overview here:
C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\chunks-alpha\pmc\product\01-bmo-overview.md`

The last chunks building module we just successfully finished for the product here: 
C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\train-data\pmc\product\01-bmo-overview-chunk-alpha_v2.md`
This is so you can understand the current status in context AND because there are parts of this new train-data module that interact with and rely on parts of the chunks-alpha module.

### 2. Become intimately knowledgeable to the codebases of both:
1. The module we are building on top of which is this one: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\train-data\src`

2. The codebase of the wireframe that provides our UI: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\train-data\train-wireframe\src`

### 3. Now begin to examine the specifications of what we are building NOW.

1. Current Detailed Spec
Here is the existing functional requirements document `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\train-data\pmc\product\03-train-functional-requirements-before-wireframe.md` that defined the train-data module before we had the wireframe. 

That wireframe was written by FIGMA Make and the code for the VITE wireframe is here: 
C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\train-data\train-wireframe\src`

2. More Context

The following documents were used to build `03-train-functional-requirements-before-wireframe.md`:

- `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\train-data\pmc\context-ai\pmct\c-alpha-build_v3.4-LoRA-FP-100-spec.md`
- `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\train-data\pmc\context-ai\pmct\training-data-seed-instructions\c-alpha-build_v3.4-LoRA-FP-convo-steps_v2.md`
- `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\train-data\pmc\context-ai\pmct\training-data-seed-instructions\c-alpha-build_v3.4-LoRA-FP-convo-steps-carryover_v1.md`
have a lot of important details.

I include them here so you have even more background and context. Also check to see if anything important is in them that is not in the `03-train-functional-requirements-before-wireframe.md` file.

## Analysis Steps

### 1. Review Existing Functional Requirements
- Analyze each FR from the initial document
- Identify gaps in the functional requirements
- Note any areas that need more granular breakdown
- Flag any ambiguous or incomplete requirements
- Track sections to ensure complete coverage

### 3. Granular Requirement Analysis
For each FR:
- Analyze if each acceptance criterion should be its own FR
- Analyze if acceptance criteria suggest additional sub-requirements
- Break down complex requirements into modular components
- Identify implicit functionality that needs explicit requirements
- Create new FRs for significant sub-components
- Maintain clear parent-child relationships in numbering
- You MUST transform User Acceptance Criteria into testable acceptance criteria
- Ensure consistent depth across all requirements
- Every time the codebases here: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\BRun\train-data\src` or `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\BRun\train-data\train-wireframe\src` is used to define an acceptance criteria you MUST include the path to the codebase file(s) directly under the applied acceptance criteria
  - When developing acceptance criteria based on the codebases, you must explicitly reference the specific file paths directly underneath each individual acceptance criterion
  - For example, if you have multiple acceptance criteria like:
    ```
    1. The primary color palette must match the legacy implementation
       Code Reference: aplio-legacy/tailwind.config.js:25-53
    2. The typography scale must be identical to the legacy system
       Code Reference: 
       - aplio-legacy/styles/typography.css:12-45
       - aplio-legacy/components/text/Text.tsx:8-32
    3. The spacing system must maintain visual consistency
       Code Reference: aplio-legacy/styles/spacing.css:5-28
    ```
  - Each acceptance criterion must have its own path reference(s) directly underneath it
  - If an acceptance criterion is validated against multiple files, include all relevant paths
  - Do not group path references at the end of sections - they must be directly under their specific criterion

### 4. Overview Document Integration
CRITICAL: You MUST:
- Read the project overview documents thoroughly
- Identify requirements mentioned in overview but missing from FRs
- Create new FRs for any functionality described in overview but not described in the USs
- Cross-reference overview sections in new FRs
- Flag any conflicts between overview and existing FRs
- Identify system-wide requirements that may have been overlooked
