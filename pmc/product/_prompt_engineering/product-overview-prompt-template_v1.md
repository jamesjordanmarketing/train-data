## Additional Requirements
- The document must be **detailed, structured, and explicit**â€”it is intended for 
an **Autonomous AI Agent**, which lacks human intuition and must be guided with highly granular instructions.
- All user stories must be stories of **end users, customers, or stakeholders of the end product**. 
We are not documenting user stories of the team building the product.
- The style and depth should match the **provided Example Document** 
(`{REFERENCE_EXAMPLE_PATH}`).
- The document must serve **dual purposes**:
  1. **Operational Guide for AI Agents who will use these stories to build this product**
  2. **Trackable Objectives for Product Managers who are responsible for making 
  sure the requirements of the end users, customers & stakeholders of the product are met**
- Before generating content, spend **30 seconds carefully analyzing the problem statement**.
