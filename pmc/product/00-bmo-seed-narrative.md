## 🚀 Big Picture

**4-Word Vision:**  
Democratizing LoRA Training Creation

**One-Sentence Summary:**  
Bright Run transforms unstructured business knowledge into high-quality LoRA training data through an intuitive 6-stage workflow designed for non-technical users, enabling small businesses to create custom AI models that think with their unique expertise and speak with their distinctive voice.

**The Core Problem:**  
Small business owners and domain experts possess invaluable proprietary knowledge—from marketing philosophies to operational processes—but lack the technical expertise to transform this knowledge into AI training data. Current LoRA fine-tuning tools are either non-existent, technically complex, or produce low-quality results, creating an insurmountable barrier for businesses wanting to create AI that truly reflects their unique cognitive identity.

**How Life Changes:**  
Business experts confidently upload their transcripts, documents, and knowledge sources, then watch as Bright Run's guided workflow transforms their raw expertise into thousands of high-quality training pairs. They gain a proprietary cognitive asset—a structured dataset that captures their unique beliefs, processes, and voice—ready for LoRA fine-tuning. Instead of generic AI responses, they get models that think and communicate exactly like their organization's most seasoned expert.
