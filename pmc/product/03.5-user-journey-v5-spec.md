## Cross-Stage Integration

### User Journey Flow
The complete user experience progresses through six interconnected stages, each building upon the previous while delivering independent value. **Stage 1** establishes the foundation with project organization and privacy demonstration. **Stage 2** handles technical complexity transparently while preserving content quality. **Stage 3** reveals knowledge insights through intelligent organization. **Stage 4** creates high-quality training pairs with expert methodology preservation. **Stage 5** ensures quality through collaborative validation. **Stage 6** delivers exponential value through synthetic multiplication.

### Value Amplification
Each stage amplifies the value created in previous stages: organized knowledge (Stage 1) enables effective content processing (Stage 2), which facilitates intelligent exploration (Stage 3), leading to quality training pair generation (Stage 4), validated through systematic review (Stage 5), and multiplied exponentially through synthetic generation (Stage 6). This progression demonstrates clear value building toward the final outcome.

### Development Efficiency
The sequence optimizes development by establishing core infrastructure early (Stages 1-2), building AI capabilities progressively (Stages 3-4), adding collaboration features (Stage 5), and implementing sophisticated synthetic generation (Stage 6). Each stage can be developed and tested independently while building toward the complete workflow.
