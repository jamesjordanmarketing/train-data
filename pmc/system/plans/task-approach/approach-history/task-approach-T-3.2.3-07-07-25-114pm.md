# Task Approach - T-3.2.3

## Task ID
T-3.2.3

## Overview
I will implement an Accordion container component that orchestrates existing AccordionItem components from T-3.2.2 using a server component architecture. The container will provide variant support (single-open/multiple-open), state management patterns (controlled/uncontrolled), and focus coordination while preserving T-3.2.2's animation system and accessibility features.

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Foundation Analysis and DSAP Discovery**
   - Analyze existing AccordionItem.tsx, AccordionProvider, and useAccordionAnimation integration points
   - Complete DSAP documentation discovery for container patterns and animation coordination
   - Study legacy CustomFAQ.jsx container implementation for variant behavior patterns
   - Review T-3.2.2's state management approach to avoid conflicts

2. **Server Component Container Architecture**
   - Create Accordion.tsx as optimized server component following P002-SERVER-COMPONENT pattern
   - Implement static rendering with dynamic client component coordination
   - Design props interface supporting both controlled and uncontrolled usage patterns
   - Establish variant prop system for single-open vs multiple-open modes

3. **State Management and Coordination System**
   - Implement hybrid state approach: server rendering + client coordination via AccordionProvider
   - Create controlled mode: parent manages openItems array, container coordinates state
   - Create uncontrolled mode: container manages internal state, delegates to AccordionItem components
   - Build variant logic: single-open auto-closes others, multiple-open allows concurrent states

4. **Focus Management and Accessibility**
   - Extend T-3.2.2's keyboard navigation to multi-item scenarios
   - Implement arrow key navigation between accordion headers
   - Add Home/End key support for first/last item focus
   - Coordinate focus restoration when items are dynamically shown/hidden
   - Maintain ARIA accordion pattern compliance across container

5. **Integration Testing and Validation**
   - Extend T-3.2.2's 18-scaffold testing framework for multi-item scenarios
   - Test container-item state synchronization and variant behavior switching
   - Validate focus management with keyboard navigation across multiple items
   - Ensure animation coordination doesn't interfere with T-3.2.2's 300ms transitions
   - Execute enhanced visual testing protocol with sequential LLM analysis

## Key Considerations

- Must preserve T-3.2.2's existing AccordionItem functionality and 300ms animation timing
- Focus management system must extend, not replace, T-3.2.2's keyboard navigation patterns  
- Server component optimization while maintaining full client-side interactivity coordination
- DSAP compliance target â‰¥95% following T-3.2.2's 98% achievement baseline
- Integration testing requires validation of container-item state synchronization performance
