# Task Approach: T-1.2.1

## Task ID
T-1.2.1

## Overview
Configure TypeScript with enhanced strict mode, optimize path aliases for cleaner imports, and integrate comprehensive ESLint TypeScript rules for code quality enforcement.

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Analyze Current Configuration** - Review existing tsconfig.json to identify gaps in strict mode settings and path alias optimization opportunities.

2. **Enhance TypeScript Configuration** - Enable all strict mode compiler options including noImplicitAny, strictNullChecks, strictFunctionTypes, and additional strict settings. Configure comprehensive path aliases beyond the basic @/* mapping for better import organization.

3. **Upgrade ESLint Integration** - Extend current ESLint config with TypeScript-specific rules for type safety, naming conventions, and code consistency. Add parser options and plugins for enhanced TypeScript linting.

4. **Configure Development Environment** - Set up VSCode settings for optimal TypeScript development experience with strict mode enabled, including editor validation and formatting rules.

5. **Validate Configuration** - Test TypeScript compilation with strict mode, verify path alias resolution, and ensure ESLint properly enforces TypeScript rules across the codebase.

## Key Considerations

- Maintain compatibility with Next.js 14 TypeScript integration and bundler requirements
- Ensure strict mode doesn't break existing code that may need gradual type safety improvements  
- Path aliases must work with both development and build processes seamlessly
- ESLint rules should enhance code quality without being overly restrictive for development flow
- Configuration changes must support the existing project structure and build pipeline

## Confidence Level
8

The task involves well-established TypeScript and ESLint configuration patterns with clear acceptance criteria. Existing partial configuration provides a solid foundation to build upon.

# Task Approach for T-1.2.2: Component Type Definitions

## Task ID
T-1.2.2

## Overview
Create comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for component props and state using patterns from legacy Hero.jsx and FaqItem.jsx. Focus on reusable type definitions that leverage the validated TypeScript strict mode configuration.

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Analyze Legacy Patterns** - Extract prop and state patterns from Hero.jsx (static props) and FaqItem.jsx (interactive props with refs and handlers)
   - Hero: Static content props, optional className overrides, animation wrapper patterns
   - FaqItem: Interactive props (question/answer strings, boolean state, click handlers), ref patterns

2. **Create Base Type Definitions** - Establish foundational interfaces in `/aplio-modern-1/types/components/`
   - Common prop interfaces (className, children, id attributes)
   - Event handler type aliases (onClick, onSubmit, etc.)
   - Animation wrapper prop types based on FadeUpAnimation usage

3. **Implement Component-Specific Types** - Define specialized interfaces for identified patterns
   - Hero component: Static content props, SVG component props, button variant types
   - FAQ component: Interactive state props, accordion behavior types, ref forwarding types

4. **Establish Generic Type Patterns** - Create reusable generic types for component families
   - Generic button props with variant unions, Generic container props with responsive classes
   - Generic state management types for toggle/accordion behaviors

5. **Validate Type Consistency** - Test type definitions against existing TypeScript infrastructure
   - Verify strict mode compatibility, Test generic type constraints
   - Validate prop spreading and composition patterns

## Key Considerations

- Leverage enhanced TypeScript strict mode (6 additional options) for maximum type safety
- Ensure compatibility with existing path aliases (@/*, @/components/*, etc.)
- Maintain consistency with Next.js 14 App Router component patterns
- Support both client-side ('use client') and server component type definitions
- Include proper JSX element and ref forwarding type support

## Confidence Level
8 - High confidence based on validated TypeScript infrastructure and clear legacy component patterns to analyze
