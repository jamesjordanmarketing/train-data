# Task Approach for T-2.3.2

## Task ID
T-2.3.2

## Overview
Create comprehensive interactive animation pattern documentation in `aplio-modern-1/design-system/docs/animations/interactive/` following T-2.3.1's successful pattern that achieved 98/100 implementation readiness score. I will analyze legacy interactive animation patterns from hover/focus states, transitions, and touch alternatives to produce implementation-ready specifications with precise timing values and accessibility features.

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Legacy Interactive Pattern Analysis Phase**: Systematically examine interactive animation implementations across `aplio-legacy/scss/_button.scss` lines 2-7 (hover/focus), `aplio-legacy/components/shared/FaqItem.jsx` lines 39-43 (transitions), and `aplio-legacy/scss/_common.scss` lines 26-38 (touch alternatives) to extract precise timing values, easing functions, and interaction patterns.

2. **Documentation Structure Creation**: Establish `animations/interactive/` directory and create 4-5 comprehensive documentation files (12KB-25KB each) with consistent markdown structure: hover-animations.md, focus-animations.md, touch-interactions.md, state-transitions.md, and implementation-guide.md, following T-2.3.1's successful pattern.

3. **Interactive Specification Documentation**: Document each animation pattern with implementation-ready specifications including exact timing values (duration/delay), easing function parameters, Framer Motion integration examples, React component integration patterns, and accessibility considerations for focus and hover states.

4. **Touch Device Alternative Documentation**: Include comprehensive touch device alternatives for hover animations, following modern accessibility standards and providing fallback patterns for mobile/tablet devices.

5. **Validation and Quality Assurance**: Validate all legacy code references for 100% accuracy (critical requirement), ensure comprehensive dark mode coverage (25+ references), verify implementation-readiness of all specifications (200+ timing references minimum), and test documentation completeness against T-2.3.1 success standards.

## Key Considerations

- **Legacy Reference Accuracy**: All animation pattern references must cite correct file paths and line numbers - 100% accuracy required for validation success
- **T-2.3.1 Quality Standards**: Must replicate 104KB documentation quality, 98/100 readiness score, and complete dark mode coverage
- **Interactive Animation Focus**: Include hover, focus, click/tap, and state transition animations with accessibility emphasis
- **Touch Device Compatibility**: Comprehensive documentation of touch alternatives for hover-dependent animations
- **Implementation-Ready Specifications**: 200+ timing references minimum, extensive Framer Motion and React patterns

## Confidence Level
9 - High confidence based on T-2.3.1's complete validation success and clear legacy interactive animation references to analyze
