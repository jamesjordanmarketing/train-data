# Task Approach for T-1.1.4: Loading and Error States Implementation

## Task ID
T-1.1.4

## Overview
I'll implement Next.js 14 loading.tsx files and error.tsx files across route segments, enhance existing dashboard states, and add Suspense boundaries around dynamic content for improved UX during data fetching and error scenarios.

## Implementation Strategy
1. Audit Current Loading and Error States
   * Review existing dashboard loading.tsx and error.tsx for patterns
   * Identify missing states: (marketing), (auth), login/, signup/, about/
   * Document Suspense usage and identify components needing async loading
   * Analyze hierarchy for optimal error boundary placement

2. Create Missing Loading States (ELE-1)
   * Implement loading.tsx for (marketing), (auth), login/, signup/, about/
   * Design consistent loading UI with spinners and contextual messaging
   * Add Suspense boundaries around dynamic imports and async components
   * Ensure clear feedback during navigation and data fetching

3. Implement Comprehensive Error Handling (ELE-2)
   * Create error.tsx files for missing route segments with consistent UI
   * Implement client-side error boundaries with reset and navigation options
   * Add handling for network, authentication, and server errors
   * Provide meaningful messages and recovery actions

4. Enhance Loading UX with Suspense Integration
   * Wrap async components with Suspense for granular loading control
   * Implement progressive loading for complex pages with multiple dependencies
   * Add loading skeletons for content areas benefiting from shape preservation
   * Optimize for mobile and desktop with responsive design

5. Test and Validate Error Recovery Patterns
   * Implement artificial delays for testing loading states
   * Create error simulation tools for testing scenarios and recovery flows
   * Validate error boundary isolation to prevent cascading failures
   * Ensure accessibility with proper ARIA labels and focus management

## Key Considerations
* Maintain consistency with existing dashboard loading/error patterns for unified UX
* Ensure error boundaries don't interfere with Next.js App Router navigation and hydration
* Implement responsive loading states that work across different viewport sizes and devices
* Follow Next.js 14 best practices for file-based routing with loading.tsx and error.tsx conventions
* Design error states with clear recovery actions and helpful messaging for user guidance

## Confidence Level
8 - High confidence. Clear requirements, existing patterns to follow, straightforward Next.js conventions, familiar with loading/error state patterns, some complexity around optimal Suspense placement.
