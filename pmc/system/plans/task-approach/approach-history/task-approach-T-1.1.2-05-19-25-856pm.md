# Task Approach for T-1.1.2: App Router Directory Structure Implementation

## Task ID
T-1.1.2

## Overview
I'll implement a comprehensive Next.js 14 App Router directory structure with distinct route groups for marketing and authenticated sections, following Next.js conventions for special files and efficient navigation paths.

## Implementation Strategy
1. Analyze Legacy Directory Structure
   * Review legacy app directory structure to understand routing patterns
   * Identify key routes and their relationships to inform modern implementation
   * Map legacy routes to Next.js 14 App Router architecture
   * Determine which special files (layout, loading, error) are needed per route

2. Create Base Directory Structure
   * Implement root app directory with essential files (layout.tsx, page.tsx)
   * Set up route groups for marketing (marketing) and authenticated (auth) sections
   * Create shared components directory within app for reusable UI elements
   * Establish global assets and styles directories for cross-route resources

3. Implement Route-Specific Files
   * Create route-specific pages with placeholder content
   * Add layout files for sections requiring unique layouts
   * Implement loading.tsx and error.tsx files for key routes
   * Set up shared metadata across route groups

4. API Route Structure
   * Create api directory with appropriate route structure
   * Set up route handlers for key API endpoints
   * Implement API routing patterns following Next.js 14 conventions

## Key Considerations
* Follow Next.js 14 naming conventions for special files (layout, page, loading, error)
* Ensure route groups clearly separate marketing from authenticated content
* Maintain directory structure that enables efficient and intuitive navigation
* Design structure to support future component and page implementation

## Confidence Level
9 - Very high confidence in implementing App Router directory structure based on extensive experience with Next.js App Router and clear requirements.
