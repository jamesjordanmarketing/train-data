# Task Approach for T-5.5.2: FAQ Item Implementation

## Task ID
T-5.5.2

## Overview
I'll create a modern server component for individual FAQ items by converting the legacy client FaqItem.jsx to a TypeScript server component with proper semantic HTML, responsive styling, and WCAG accessibility.

## Implementation Strategy
1. Create Server Component Structure
   * Build TypeScript server component at components/faq/home-4/faq/FaqItem.tsx following P002-SERVER-COMPONENT pattern
   * Implement semantic HTML structure using proper heading hierarchy and button/answer elements
   * Add TypeScript interfaces for question and answer props with strict typing
   * Remove client-side state management and hooks since this is a server component

2. Extract Legacy Typography and Styling Patterns
   * Analyze legacy FaqItem.jsx question styling: text-xl font-semibold with proper Q. prefix formatting
   * Implement answer styling: px-6 pb-3.5 pt-6 text-paragraph-light with responsive text sizing
   * Apply proper container styling: rounded-medium bg-white p-2.5 with dark mode support
   * Ensure border styling matches: border-dashed border-gray-100 with proper spacing

3. Implement Responsive Typography System
   * Configure text sizing with responsive breakpoints: text-xl for question, text-paragraph-light for answer
   * Apply proper spacing tokens: px-5 py-3 for question container, px-6 pb-3.5 pt-6 for answer content
   * Implement mobile-responsive adjustments with max-md:gap-x-2.5 for smaller screens
   * Use design tokens for consistent typography scaling across viewport sizes

4. Build Accessible Question/Answer Structure
   * Create semantic button element for question with proper ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation
   * Implement answer content with proper paragraph structure and color contrast ratios
   * Add proper heading hierarchy using h3 or h4 elements for question text content
   * Ensure WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with proper focus states and screen reader support

5. Integrate Server Component Architecture
   * Design component to receive question/answer data as props without client state management
   * Create TypeScript interfaces for FaqItemProps with question: string, answer: string properties
   * Implement static rendering without useRef, useState, or other client-side React hooks
   * Ensure component can be imported and used within the FAQ section layout from T-5.5.1

## Key Considerations
* Follow server component patterns - no client hooks or interactive state management
* Match legacy styling exactly - text-xl font-semibold questions, proper spacing tokens
* Implement proper WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility with semantic HTML and ARIA attributes
* Use responsive typography with mobile-first breakpoints and consistent design tokens
* Ensure TypeScript strict typing for all component props and maintain type safety

## Confidence Level
8 - High confidence. Clear legacy reference, straightforward component conversion, familiar patterns, well-defined accessibility requirements, and established server component architecture.
