# Task Approach for T-2.1.4: Animation and Transition System Extraction

## Task ID
T-2.1.4

## Overview
I will extract animation timing values, easing functions, and transition durations from the legacy Aplio codebase into TypeScript design tokens following the successful T-2.1.3 spacing pattern. This involves creating a comprehensive animations.ts file with type-safe tokens that preserve exact legacy animation behavior while implementing modern TypeScript interfaces.

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Extract Animation Timing Values (ELE-1)**
   - Analyze animation.js lines 1-10 to extract base durations (0.5s) and delay patterns (0.2s, 0.4s, 0.6s)
   - Create TypeScript animation timing interfaces following spacing.ts pattern
   - Implement base timing scale with duration and delay token definitions
   - Add semantic timing names (fast, normal, slow) for different animation speeds

2. **Document Easing Functions (ELE-2)**
   - Extract easing implementations from tailwind.config.js lines 73-93 (keyframes section)
   - Identify custom easing patterns: bounce-open, floating (ease-in-out infinite), floatingDown
   - Create easing function token definitions with cubic-bezier values
   - Document built-in easing functions used across components (ease-in-out, linear)

3. **Map Transition Durations for Interactions (ELE-3)**
   - Analyze legacy interaction patterns from animation.js (fade, slide transitions)
   - Define transition duration mapping for hover, focus, modal, page transitions
   - Create interaction-specific timing tokens (button: 150ms, modal: 300ms, page: 500ms)
   - Implement responsive transition logic based on user preferences

4. **Create TypeScript Type System (ELE-4)**
   - Follow spacing.ts interface pattern for animation tokens (AnimationToken, TimingScale, EasingFunctions)
   - Create AnimationSystem interface combining all animation tokens
   - Implement type-safe exports with 'as const' assertions for tree-shaking
   - Add utility functions: getAnimationTiming(), getEasing(), generateAnimationCSS()

5. **Implement Animation Utility Functions**
   - Create getAnimationTiming(), getEasingFunction(), generateAnimationCSS() functions
   - Add animation builder helpers for common patterns (fadeIn, slideUp, bounce)
   - Ensure Next.js 14 optimization with proper tree-shaking support

## Key Considerations

- **Legacy Fidelity**: Exact timing preservation required - all durations (0.5s) and delays (0.2s, 0.4s, 0.6s) must match legacy exactly
- **TypeScript Safety**: Use 'as const' assertions and proper interface definitions following T-2.1.3 successful pattern
- **Pattern Consistency**: Follow spacing.ts structure for exports, interfaces, and utility functions to maintain design system coherence
- **Performance**: Optimize animation tokens for reduced bundle size and runtime performance in Next.js 14
- **Testing Adaptation**: Structure tokens for Jest validation testing using adapted design token testing protocol from T-2.1.3

## Confidence Level
9/10 - Very high confidence based on successful T-2.1.2 and T-2.1.3 implementations providing proven TypeScript design token pattern. Animation system is well-defined in legacy code with clear extraction points. Strong foundation from context-carry info showing T-2.1.3 testing protocol success.
