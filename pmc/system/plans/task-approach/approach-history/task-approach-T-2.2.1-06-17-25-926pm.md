# Task Approach for T-2.2.1

## Task ID
T-2.2.1

## Overview
I will systematically document the visual characteristics of core UI components (buttons, inputs, cards) by analyzing the legacy SCSS and React implementations to extract precise design specifications. This approach leverages the validated breakpoint system from T-2.1.6 to create comprehensive visual documentation for the Next.js 14 design system implementation.

## Implementation Strategy
1. **Legacy Analysis Phase**: Extract visual specifications from legacy files (`_button.scss`, `_common.scss`, `Feature.jsx`) including colors, dimensions, typography, border-radius, shadows, and hover effects
   - Button variants: `.btn`, `.btn-outline`, `.btn-sm` with state transitions and dark mode variants
   - Input fields: Focus states, border styling, background colors, sizing specifications
   - Card components: Shadow effects, border radius, padding, hover animations, dark mode support

2. **Component State Mapping**: Document all interactive states (default, hover, active, disabled) for each component type
   - Extract Tailwind classes and transform them into design token specifications
   - Map color values using CSS custom properties for theme consistency
   - Document animation timing and transition effects

3. **Visual Documentation Creation**: Generate structured markdown files in `design-system/docs/components/core/` directory
   - Create separate files: `buttons.md`, `inputs.md`, `cards.md`, `component-states.md`
   - Include code examples, visual specifications, and implementation guidelines
   - Document responsive behavior using validated breakpoint system

4. **Documentation Template Implementation**: Establish consistent format for component documentation
   - Visual characteristics (colors, typography, spacing, borders)
   - Behavioral specifications (hover effects, transitions, animations)
   - Accessibility considerations and ARIA patterns
   - Code examples and usage guidelines

5. **Cross-Reference and Validation**: Verify documentation accuracy against legacy implementation
   - Compare extracted specifications with actual rendered components
   - Ensure completeness of all visual states and variants
   - Validate integration with existing design token system

## Key Considerations
- Legacy button system uses complex before/after pseudo-elements for hover animations that need precise documentation
- Dark mode variants are implemented via Tailwind dark: prefix and must be fully captured in specifications
- Card components use shadow-nav utility class requiring custom shadow documentation for design system
- Input components may have additional states beyond basic focus/blur that need identification and documentation
- Component documentation must align with validated breakpoint system from T-2.1.6 for responsive behavior

## Confidence Level
8 - High confidence in successful completion. The task involves systematic documentation of existing visual implementations with clear legacy references and established patterns from the validated breakpoint system work.
