# Task Approach: T-2.5.5

## Overview
I will implement a comprehensive CSS architecture that provides the foundational layer for the completed T-2.5.4 Style Composition System. The approach focuses on creating CSS custom properties in `--aplio-*` format, modern reset principles, global responsive foundations, and media query systems that enable seamless theme switching and composition utility integration.

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Create Modern CSS Reset (ELE-1)**
   - Implement `reset.css` at `aplio-modern-1/styles/globals/` using modern principles from legacy `_common.scss` lines 1-25
   - Focus on box-sizing, normalize margins/padding, and consistent typography baseline
   - Ensure reset doesn't conflict with T-2.5.4 composition utilities or CSS custom properties
   - Test cross-browser compatibility and integration with existing global styles

2. **Generate CSS Custom Properties (ELE-2)**
   - Convert all T-2.5.3 semantic tokens to CSS variables in `--aplio-{category}-{property}` format
   - Create `variables.css` that maps theme tokens to CSS custom properties for automatic theme switching
   - Ensure variable names align exactly with T-2.5.4 composition system expectations (button, card, input, typography)
   - Generate both light and dark theme variable sets using existing theme provider data
   - Reference legacy `colors.ts` lines 298-310 for CSS variable generation patterns

3. **Implement Global Style Foundation (ELE-3)**
   - Create `base.css` with responsive typography, spacing, and layout foundations
   - Extract global style patterns from legacy `_common.scss` lines 26-317 while modernizing approach
   - Implement styles using CSS custom properties to maintain theme reactivity
   - Ensure global styles complement rather than conflict with composition utilities
   - Focus on typography scales, spacing systems, and component base styles

4. **Develop Responsive Media Query System (ELE-4)**
   - Create `breakpoints.css` with media query utilities compatible with T-2.5.4 responsive composition
   - Use breakpoint definitions from legacy `tailwind.config.js` lines 13-17 (sm, md, lg, xl, 2xl)
   - Implement CSS custom property responsive patterns that work with theme switching
   - Create responsive utility classes that integrate with composition system expectations
   - Test responsive behavior across all viewport sizes with theme switching

5. **Integration and Testing**
   - Import all CSS files into Next.js 14 build system through `app/globals.css`
   - Validate T-2.5.4 composition utilities function correctly with CSS foundation
   - Test theme switching preserves CSS custom property reactivity
   - Verify button, card, input, and typography variants render correctly with new CSS infrastructure

## Key Considerations

- CSS custom properties must match exact `--aplio-*` naming expected by T-2.5.4 composition utilities
- Theme switching functionality must remain automatic without component re-renders using CSS variables
- Global styles must provide foundation without conflicting with composition utility approach
- Media queries must use same breakpoint names/values as T-2.5.4 responsive composition utilities
- All CSS must be compatible with Next.js 14 App Router build system and existing theme provider

## Confidence Level
8/10 - High confidence based on clear task requirements, excellent carryover context from T-2.5.4 completion, and well-defined legacy code references. The integration points are clearly documented and the CSS custom property architecture is well-established.
