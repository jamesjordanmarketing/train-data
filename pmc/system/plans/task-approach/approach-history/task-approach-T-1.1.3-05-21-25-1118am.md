# Task Approach for T-1.1.3: Server Component Implementation

## Task ID
T-1.1.3

## Overview
I'll implement a Next.js 14 component architecture optimizing server/client boundaries - using server components by default for non-interactive parts, client components only where needed, and composing them together following recommended patterns.

## Implementation Strategy
1. Analyze Component Interactivity Needs
   * Review the existing directory structure to identify all page components
   * Classify components based on interactivity requirements (server vs client)
   * Identify potential server components (static content, data fetching, SEO elements)
   * Flag interactive UI elements requiring client components (forms, buttons with state, accordions)

2. Implement Server Components
   * Create base server components for layouts and pages (default behavior in Next.js 14)
   * Implement data fetching within server components for optimal performance 
   * Ensure SEO-critical elements are server-rendered for best indexing
   * Apply proper metadata handling in server components for SEO optimization

3. Implement Client Components
   * Create client components with 'use client' directive for interactive elements
   * Implement state management within client components
   * Keep client components focused and minimal to reduce JavaScript bundle size
   * Pass server data to client components as props to maintain data flow

4. Establish Component Composition Patterns
   * Implement server components that render client components (not vice versa)
   * Pass data from server to client components through props
   * Create shared component interfaces that work across server/client boundaries
   * Document component boundaries for future development reference

## Key Considerations
* Use server components by default for all non-interactive content
* Keep client components small and focused on interactivity only
* Never import server components into client components (breaks React's programming model)
* Ensure proper data flow between server and client component boundaries

## Confidence Level
8 - High confidence in implementing server components based on clear Next.js 14 patterns and previous experience.
