# Task Approach: T-1.2.1

## Task ID
T-1.2.1

## Overview
Configure TypeScript with enhanced strict mode, optimize path aliases for cleaner imports, and integrate comprehensive ESLint TypeScript rules for code quality enforcement.

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Analyze Current Configuration** - Review existing tsconfig.json to identify gaps in strict mode settings and path alias optimization opportunities.

2. **Enhance TypeScript Configuration** - Enable all strict mode compiler options including noImplicitAny, strictNullChecks, strictFunctionTypes, and additional strict settings. Configure comprehensive path aliases beyond the basic @/* mapping for better import organization.

3. **Upgrade ESLint Integration** - Extend current ESLint config with TypeScript-specific rules for type safety, naming conventions, and code consistency. Add parser options and plugins for enhanced TypeScript linting.

4. **Configure Development Environment** - Set up VSCode settings for optimal TypeScript development experience with strict mode enabled, including editor validation and formatting rules.

5. **Validate Configuration** - Test TypeScript compilation with strict mode, verify path alias resolution, and ensure ESLint properly enforces TypeScript rules across the codebase.

## Key Considerations

- Maintain compatibility with Next.js 14 TypeScript integration and bundler requirements
- Ensure strict mode doesn't break existing code that may need gradual type safety improvements  
- Path aliases must work with both development and build processes seamlessly
- ESLint rules should enhance code quality without being overly restrictive for development flow
- Configuration changes must support the existing project structure and build pipeline

## Confidence Level
8

The task involves well-established TypeScript and ESLint configuration patterns with clear acceptance criteria. Existing partial configuration provides a solid foundation to build upon.
