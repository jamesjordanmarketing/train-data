# Task Approach for T-2.2.6: Component Relationship Documentation

## Task ID
T-2.2.6

## Overview
I will create comprehensive architecture-level documentation that maps component relationships across the design system by analyzing composition patterns in home-4/page.jsx, cross-component styling in _common.scss, typography consistency in _typography.scss, and variant relationships in colors.json. This approach builds on T-2.2.5's individual component documentation to create system-wide relationship specifications.

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Component Composition Analysis** (PREP-1, IMP-1)
   - Analyze home-4/page.jsx component hierarchy revealing nested layout patterns with containers, sections, and feature components
   - Document parent-child relationships between page-level components (Hero, AboutUs, CoreFeature, etc.)
   - Map component composition patterns showing how legacy components compose together in real implementations
   - Create Mermaid.js diagrams visualizing component hierarchy with data flow and dependency relationships

2. **Cross-Component Styling Pattern Documentation** (PREP-2, IMP-2)
   - Extract shared styling patterns from _common.scss lines 26-317 covering utility classes, layout systems, and responsive patterns
   - Document CSS override mechanisms and cascade patterns affecting multiple components
   - Identify global styling dependencies that components inherit or override
   - Specify how shared styles propagate through component hierarchies with specific class inheritance patterns

3. **Design System Consistency Mapping** (PREP-3, IMP-3)
   - Analyze typography consistency patterns from _typography.scss covering font hierarchies, sizing scales, and line-height relationships
   - Document spacing, color, and visual rhythm patterns that maintain consistency across components
   - Map design token usage patterns showing how consistent visual language is maintained
   - Create comprehensive dark mode pattern documentation for all relationship scenarios

4. **Component Variant Relationship Analysis** (PREP-4, IMP-4)
   - Analyze color variant relationships from colors.json lines 163-220 covering semantic color mappings and theme variants
   - Document how component variants relate across different UI contexts and states
   - Map variant inheritance patterns showing how design variations cascade through related components
   - Create variant relationship matrices showing interaction patterns between different component states

5. **Architecture Documentation and Visual Validation** (IMP-5, VAL-1 through VAL-4)
   - Create comprehensive architecture-level documentation in design-system/docs/architecture/ directory
   - Generate visual relationship diagrams using Mermaid.js for component hierarchies and styling relationships
   - Validate all documented relationships against actual legacy implementations
   - Ensure documentation references T-2.2.5 individual component specifications rather than duplicating content

## Key Considerations

- **Architecture-Level Focus**: Documentation must capture system-wide patterns rather than individual component characteristics, building on T-2.2.5 foundation
- **Component Composition Complexity**: Legacy home-4 page shows complex nesting with containers, sections, and dynamic component arrangements requiring precise hierarchy mapping
- **Comprehensive Dark Mode Coverage**: All relationship patterns must include dark mode variants addressing T-2.2.5 gap where 2 files missed dark mode coverage
- **Cross-Component CSS Inheritance**: _common.scss contains complex cascade patterns affecting multiple components requiring detailed override mechanism documentation
- **Visual Relationship Documentation**: Mermaid.js integration for creating accurate component relationship diagrams with proper technical specifications

## Confidence Level
8

This task builds directly on T-2.2.5's proven documentation approach while extending to architecture-level analysis. The legacy codebase provides clear examples of component relationships, and the systematic analysis approach aligns with established PMC protocols. The focus on relationships rather than individual components presents moderate complexity requiring careful analysis of interconnected patterns.
