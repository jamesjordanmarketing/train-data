# Task Approach: T-2.1.1

## Task ID
T-2.1.1

## Overview
I will extract the complete color system from the legacy Aplio tailwind.config.js file and implement type-safe TypeScript color tokens for Next.js 14. The approach involves analyzing the existing color palette (primary, dark, gray, border, paragraph, rating) with their variations, creating TypeScript interfaces for color tokens, and structuring them in an optimized format at styles/design-tokens/colors.ts with comprehensive state variations.

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Legacy Color Analysis and Extraction**
   - Extract primary colors (DEFAULT: #B1E346, 100: #F3F8E8, 200: #C4F241) from tailwind.config.js lines 25-56
   - Document dark theme colors (DEFAULT: #131410, variants 100-300) and gray system (DEFAULT: #F6F8F1, variants 50-200)
   - Capture specialized colors (borderColor, paragraph, rating) with exact hex values for visual accuracy
   - Map color usage patterns to identify missing state variations needed for modern implementation

2. **TypeScript Color Token Structure Design**
   - Create ColorPalette interface defining primary, secondary, accent, neutral color scales with proper typing
   - Design ColorToken type supporting DEFAULT, numeric variants (50, 100, 200, etc.), and semantic naming
   - Implement ColorStateVariations interface for hover, active, focus, disabled states using consistent naming conventions
   - Structure color organization following design token best practices for scalability

3. **Color Token Implementation and Documentation**
   - Create styles/design-tokens/colors.ts file with complete color constant definitions as TypeScript objects
   - Implement type-safe exports using const assertions and proper typing for all color tokens
   - Document state variations (hover: 10% darker, active: 15% darker, focus: ring colors, disabled: 50% opacity)
   - Structure tokens in format optimized for Next.js 14 CSS-in-JS and Tailwind CSS integration

4. **Directory Structure and Organization**
   - Create styles/design-tokens/ directory structure following modern design system patterns
   - Organize color tokens by category (primary, semantic, state) with clear export patterns
   - Implement barrel exports for easy consumption across Next.js 14 components
   - Structure files to support future design token expansion (typography, spacing, etc.)

5. **Validation and Type Safety Verification**
   - Verify extracted colors match legacy implementation pixel-perfect using visual comparison
   - Validate TypeScript interfaces compile correctly and provide proper IDE intellisense
   - Test color token imports and usage patterns in Next.js 14 environment
   - Ensure 90% test coverage with comprehensive color token validation tests

## Key Considerations

- Legacy tailwind.config.js contains complete color definitions requiring exact hex value preservation
- TypeScript type safety critical for design system consistency and developer experience  
- Next.js 14 optimization requires proper tree-shaking support through structured exports
- State variations need systematic approach since legacy system lacks comprehensive interactive states
- Directory structure must support future design token expansion while maintaining organization

## Confidence Level
9 - Very high confidence in successful implementation. The legacy color system is well-defined in tailwind.config.js with clear hex values. TypeScript color token patterns are established best practices. The task has clear acceptance criteria and references. Main complexity is ensuring comprehensive state variations and optimal organization, but the foundation is solid and straightforward.
