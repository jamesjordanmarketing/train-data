# Task Approach - T-3.2.2

## Overview
Build AccordionItem client component with smooth expand/collapse animations and full accessibility compliance. Leverage T-3.2.1 infrastructure and proven testing framework from comprehensive testing protocol. Focus on animation timing, ARIA patterns, and variable height content handling.

## Implementation Strategy

**1. Design System Analysis (PREP Phase)**
- Complete DSAP Documentation Discovery for accordion patterns in `aplio-modern-1/design-system/docs/`
- Analyze legacy FaqItem component (`aplio-legacy/components/shared/FaqItem.jsx`) for animation timing and interaction patterns
- Extract height transition logic, easing functions, and icon rotation synchronization requirements
- Review T-3.2.1 AccordionProvider Context integration points for state management

**2. Client Component Implementation (IMP Phase - ELE-1)**
- Create AccordionItem client component with expand/collapse state management using React useState
- Implement useContext hook integration with AccordionProvider for coordinated state
- Build component structure following P003-CLIENT-COMPONENT pattern with proper server/client boundaries
- Add proper TypeScript interfaces extending T-3.2.1 type definitions

**3. Animation Implementation (IMP Phase - ELE-2, ELE-3)**
- Implement smooth height transitions using CSS transforms and React state for content visibility
- Add icon rotation animations synchronized with expand/collapse state using CSS transitions
- Extract timing values from legacy implementation (duration, easing) and apply P018-TRANSITION-ANIMATION pattern
- Handle variable height content with proper measurement and transition management

**4. Accessibility Implementation (IMP Phase - ELE-4)**
- Implement ARIA accordion pattern with proper button/region relationships and aria-expanded states
- Add keyboard navigation support (Tab, Enter, Space) with focus management
- Ensure screen reader compatibility with proper ARIA labels and descriptions
- Add focus indicators and high contrast mode support following accessibility guidelines

**5. Testing and Validation (VAL Phase)**
- Leverage T-3.2.1 testing infrastructure with visual scaffolds and enhanced LLM vision analysis
- Test animation smoothness, timing accuracy, and variable height content handling
- Validate ARIA compliance and keyboard navigation with automated accessibility testing
- Create comprehensive test reports following T-3.2.1 testing protocol template

## Key Considerations

**• Animation Performance**: Use CSS transforms for smooth 60fps animations with proper easing functions extracted from legacy code

**• Context Integration**: Properly integrate with T-3.2.1 AccordionProvider Context for coordinated multi-item state management

**• Accessibility Compliance**: Full ARIA accordion pattern implementation with keyboard navigation and screen reader support

**• Testing Infrastructure**: Leverage proven T-3.2.1 testing framework with 95% confidence visual analysis and comprehensive reports

**• Variable Height Content**: Implement robust height measurement and transition system for dynamic content sizing

## Dependencies
- T-3.2.1 Accordion Component Structure and Types (Completed - 98.7% confidence)
- AccordionProvider Context system from T-3.2.1 implementation
- Legacy FaqItem component reference for animation patterns
- Proven testing infrastructure with enhanced LLM vision analysis tool

## Expected Implementation Files
- `aplio-modern-1/components/design-system/molecules/Accordion/AccordionItem.tsx` - Main component implementation
- `aplio-modern-1/test/unit-tests/task-3-2/T-3.2.2/AccordionItem.test.tsx` - Unit tests
- `test/scaffolds/T-3.2.2/accordion-item-enhanced.html` - Visual testing scaffold
- `test/reports/T-3.2.2-testing-summary.md` - Testing summary report
- `test/reports/T-3.2.2-testing-report.md` - Detailed testing report
- `aplio-modern-1/test/unit-tests/task-3-2/T-3.2.2/design-system-adherence-report.md` - DSAP compliance report

## Confidence Level
**8/10** - High confidence based on successful T-3.2.1 completion, proven testing infrastructure, clear legacy reference patterns, and comprehensive animation/accessibility requirements with established implementation patterns.
