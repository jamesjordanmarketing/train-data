# Task Approach - T-3.2.4

## Task ID
T-3.2.4

## Overview
I will implement comprehensive testing and optimization for the existing accordion components from T-3.2.3. Focus areas include achieving 90% test coverage, WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, performance optimization through memoization and lazy loading, and dynamic content height handling with extensive edge case testing.

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Testing Environment Setup and Baseline Analysis**
   - Analyze existing accordion implementation from T-3.2.3 (Accordion.tsx, AccordionItem.tsx, AccordionProvider.tsx)
   - Leverage existing testing infrastructure with enhanced scaffold system and LLM Vision analyzer
   - Create performance measurement baseline building on T-3.2.3's <100ms render time and 300ms animation metrics
   - Set up comprehensive testing environment with Jest, React Testing Library, and accessibility testing tools

2. **Comprehensive Unit and Integration Testing (90% Coverage)**
   - Implement unit tests for all accordion components: Accordion, AccordionItem, AccordionProvider, hooks
   - Create integration tests for container-item state synchronization and variant behavior
   - Test controlled vs uncontrolled state management patterns extensively
   - Validate focus management system with keyboard navigation across multiple accordion instances
   - Test animation coordination and timing preservation from T-3.2.2 baseline

3. **Performance Optimization and Dynamic Content Testing**
   - Implement memoization for accordion rendering using React.memo and useMemo optimizations
   - Add lazy loading for accordion content to improve initial render performance
   - Optimize animation performance with will-change CSS properties and hardware acceleration
   - Test variable content height handling with dynamic content injection and removal
   - Validate memory usage patterns and implement cleanup for event listeners

4. **Accessibility Testing and WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance**
   - Implement comprehensive screen reader testing with ARIA pattern validation
   - Test keyboard-only navigation including arrow keys, Home/End, Space/Enter interactions
   - Validate focus management with tab order and focus restoration
   - Test reduced motion preferences compliance for animation accessibility
   - Ensure color contrast and text scaling meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards

5. **Edge Case Testing and Validation**
   - Test accordion behavior with empty content, extremely long content, and nested interactive elements
   - Validate single-open vs multiple-open variant switching with state consistency
   - Test error boundaries and graceful degradation scenarios
   - Implement visual regression testing against T-3.2.3 baseline screenshots
   - Execute comprehensive cross-browser compatibility testing

## Key Considerations

- Build upon existing T-3.2.3 implementation rather than creating new components
- Maintain 96% DSAP compliance achieved in T-3.2.3 while adding comprehensive testing
- Preserve T-3.2.2's 300ms animation timing and focus management patterns
- Achieve 90% test coverage without breaking existing functionality
- Leverage existing testing infrastructure (27 screenshots, 14 LLM analysis reports)
