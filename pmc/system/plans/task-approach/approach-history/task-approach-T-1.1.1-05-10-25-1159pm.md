# Task Implementation Approach

## Task ID
T-1.1.1

## Overview
Initialize Next.js 14 project with TypeScript support using create-next-app. Set up App Router structure with essential directories and implement base configuration for a robust, maintainable project architecture.

## Implementation Strategy
1. Set up Development Environment (ELE-1)
   - Verify Node.js version compatibility (v18+ required for Next.js 14)
   - Initialize project structure in the aplio-modern-1 directory
   - Create package.json with essential scripts and dependencies as found in aplio-legacy/package.json
   - Focus on clean project architecture from the start
   - Don't install a version of Node.js that is too high for a Next.js 14 project

2. Initialize Next.js 14 Project (ELE-1)
   - Use create-next-app with TypeScript template
   - Configure project with App Router structure
   - Include essential dependencies: React 18, Next.js 14, TypeScript
   - Set up core development dependencies: ESLint, Prettier, testing utilities
   - Install supporting packages based on legacy implementation

3. Configure Project Settings (ELE-2)
   - Create next.config.js with appropriate settings for App Router
   - Set up proper TypeScript configuration in tsconfig.json
   - Implement standard .gitignore patterns for Next.js projects
   - Create README.md with project overview and setup instructions
   - Add .env.example with template environment variables

4. Test Project Setup (ELE-1, ELE-2)
   - Verify successful build process with 'npm run build'
   - Test development server with 'npm run dev'
   - Validate TypeScript configuration is working correctly
   - Ensure ESLint and other tools are properly integrated
   - Document any configuration adjustments needed

## Key Considerations
- Node.js version compatibility (v18+) is essential for Next.js 14
- App Router structure requires specific directory organization
- Proper TypeScript configuration will simplify future development
- ESLint and Prettier configuration should follow best practices
- Legacy dependencies should be carried forward with appropriate versions

## Confidence Level
9 - High confidence as this is a standard Next.js setup process with clear documentation available.
