# Task Approach - T-1.1.2

## Overview
I will validate existing WorkflowProgressServer and WorkflowProgressClient components against T-1.1.2 acceptance criteria using the validation-first approach proven successful in T-1.1.1. Focus on verifying progress tracking accuracy across all three workflow stages and navigation validation enforcement within the established App Router architecture.

## Implementation Strategy

1. **PREP Phase - Progress System Analysis**
   - Review WorkflowProgressServer.tsx structure to verify server component implementation for progress tracking
   - Analyze workflow-store.ts currentStep/completedSteps state management for progress calculation logic
   - Examine existing stage layouts (stage1/stage2/stage3 pages) to understand progress integration patterns
   - Verify WorkflowProgressClient component for navigation controls and progress display implementation

2. **IMP Phase - Progress Tracking Validation (T-1.1.2:ELE-1)**
   - Test progress bar accuracy: Stage 1 start (0%), Stage 1 complete (~33%), Stage 2 complete (~66%), Stage 3 complete (100%)
   - Validate step completion indicators and checkmarks display correctly across all workflow transitions
   - Verify progress synchronization when navigating between completed stages maintains accurate state
   - Test progress persistence across page refreshes and direct URL access scenarios

3. **IMP Phase - Navigation System Validation (T-1.1.2:ELE-2)**
   - Test navigation enforcement prevents access to incomplete stages while allowing backward navigation to completed stages
   - Validate App Router integration with dynamic document routing patterns (/workflow/[documentId]/stage1|2|3)
   - Verify navigation state persistence and URL route protection against direct manipulation
   - Test navigation controls integration with existing server/client component separation patterns

4. **VAL Phase - Complete Workflow Testing**
   - Execute complete workflow validation across all three stages with multiple document scenarios
   - Verify progress tracking accuracy and navigation validation work together seamlessly
   - Test edge cases: partially completed stages, validation failures, cross-stage navigation
   - Confirm component integration with established StepA/B/C components maintains UI consistency

## Key Considerations

- Progress components likely exist - focus on validation against specific acceptance criteria rather than creation
- Server/client component separation must be maintained per T-1.1.1 established patterns
- Progress percentage calculations must be precise: 0% → 33% → 66% → 100% across stages
- Navigation validation critical for user experience - incomplete stages must be blocked effectively
- Zustand store integration proven functional from T-1.1.1, leverage existing state management patterns

## Confidence Level
8/10 - High confidence leveraging proven validation approach from T-1.1.1. Clear acceptance criteria and established foundation systems provide solid implementation pathway.
