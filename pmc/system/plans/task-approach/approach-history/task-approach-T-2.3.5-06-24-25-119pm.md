# Task Approach: T-2.3.5

## Task ID
T-2.3.5

## Overview
Implement comprehensive accessibility documentation for design system animations using WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards. Create reduced motion alternatives, motion preference detection guides, and accessibility impact assessments that build upon T-2.3.4's timing specifications while addressing the gap in motion sensitivity considerations.

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Preparation Phase - Legacy Analysis & Standards Research**
   - Analyze existing animations in `aplio-legacy/data/animation.js` (fadeUp, fadeFromLeft/Right patterns)
   - Research WCAG 2.1 Level AA motion requirements and CSS `prefers-reduced-motion` implementation
   - Study accessibility impact on users with vestibular disorders, ADHD, and seizure sensitivity
   - Document current gaps between legacy animations and accessibility standards

2. **Documentation Architecture - 5-File Structure Pattern**  
   - Follow T-2.3.4's successful documentation pattern: Overview, Detailed Guide, Quick Reference, Examples, Testing
   - Create `aplio-modern-1/design-system/docs/animations/accessibility/` directory structure
   - Establish cross-references to T-2.3.4 timing docs for timing-based accessibility alternatives
   - Include dark mode accessibility considerations as core requirement from start

3. **Reduced Motion Implementation Documentation**
   - Document reduced motion alternatives for fadeUp, fadeFromLeft, and fadeFromRight animations
   - Create CSS and JavaScript motion preference detection techniques using `prefers-reduced-motion`
   - Establish guidelines for opacity-only alternatives versus complete motion removal
   - Include Framer Motion specific implementation patterns with accessibility variants

4. **Accessibility Guidelines & Impact Assessment**
   - Document best practices for animation accessibility across different user needs
   - Create practical assessment methods for evaluating animation accessibility impact
   - Establish testing protocols for accessibility compliance verification
   - Include assistive technology compatibility guidelines

5. **Validation & Integration Testing**
   - Validate all documentation against WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards
   - Test motion preference detection techniques across browsers and devices
   - Verify integration with T-2.3.4 timing specifications for consistency
   - Ensure TypeScript strict mode compliance for all code examples

## Key Considerations

- **Legacy Integration**: Must maintain 100% accuracy when referencing existing animation patterns from `animation.js`
- **WCAG 2.1 Level AA Compliance**: All recommendations must meet accessibility standards for motion-based content
- **Cross-Task Dependencies**: Documentation must seamlessly reference T-2.3.4 timing specifications
- **Dark Mode Accessibility**: Include dark mode motion considerations as core requirement, not afterthought
- **TypeScript Compliance**: All code examples must compile successfully with strict mode enabled

## Confidence Level
9/10

High confidence based on T-2.3.4's successful completion patterns, clear accessibility standards, and well-defined legacy reference points. The proven 5-file documentation structure and existing PMC workflow processes provide strong foundation for implementation success.
