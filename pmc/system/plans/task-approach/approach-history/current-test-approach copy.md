# T-1.2.3 API and Utility Type Definitions - Testing Approach

## Overview
Comprehensive testing of TypeScript type definitions through unit testing, type validation, and architectural compliance verification using Jest, TypeScript compiler, and MSW for API mocking with 90% coverage target.

## Testing Strategy

1. **Environment Setup & Discovery (Phase 0-1)**
   - Navigate to aplio-modern-1 directory and configure test infrastructure with Jest, TypeScript, MSW, and ts-jest
   - Discover and classify all T-1.2.3 type definitions (ELE-1: API interfaces, ELE-2: Utility function types)
   - Generate enhanced scaffolds with real TypeScript validation examples demonstrating type safety
   - Document all testable elements in current-test-discovery.md with implementation paths

2. **Unit Testing Validation (Phase 2)**
   - Execute Jest unit tests with TypeScript compilation validation for all type definitions
   - Test API type interfaces against legacy data structures (serviceData.json, faqData.json, testimonial.json, pricing.json)
   - Validate utility function types with mock implementations testing parameter/return type accuracy
   - Verify type reusability across application with import/export testing and barrel export validation

3. **Type Safety & Integration Testing (Phase 3)**
   - Use MSW to mock API responses matching type definitions and validate request/response compliance
   - Test type definitions with edge cases, invalid data, and TypeScript strict mode compilation
   - Validate generic type constraints and utility function type accuracy with various input combinations
   - Screenshot type validation examples showing IntelliSense and compilation success/failures

4. **LLM Vision Analysis & Documentation (Phase 4-5)**
   - Generate visual documentation of type definitions with usage examples and validation results
   - Create comprehensive testing reports showing 90% code coverage achievement with Jest coverage reports
   - Compile human-readable documentation of all type interfaces, utility types, and validation outcomes
   - Validate against legacy code references ensuring accurate type modeling of existing data structures

## Key Considerations

- Type definitions require compile-time validation rather than runtime testing, focusing on TypeScript compiler success
- API types must accurately model legacy JSON data structures without runtime execution requirements
- Generic type constraints critical for utility functions to prevent invalid parameter combinations
- MSW enables API contract testing without actual backend dependencies for comprehensive validation
- Infrastructure task requiring architectural compliance testing rather than visual component validation

## Confidence Level
8/10 - High confidence in systematic type testing approach with established patterns and comprehensive tooling coverage for TypeScript validation.
