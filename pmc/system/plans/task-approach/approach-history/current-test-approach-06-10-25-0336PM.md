# T-1.3.1: Component Directory Structure Setup - Testing Approach

## Task ID: T-1.3.1

## Overview
Execute comprehensive 5-phase testing protocol from environment setup through LLM Vision analysis to validate T-1.3.1 directory structure components. Focus on infrastructure testing with real React SSR scaffolds to verify proper component organization and categorization.

## Testing Strategy

1. **Environment & Discovery Phase**
   - Navigate to aplio-modern-1 directory and establish test infrastructure
   - Create complete T-1.3.1 test directory structure with all required subdirectories
   - Start enhanced test server (port 3333) and dashboard (port 3334) for React SSR testing
   - Discover and classify all T-1.3.1:ELE-1 and T-1.3.1:ELE-2 components through automated analysis
   - Generate enhanced React SSR scaffolds with real content (not mock HTML) and visual boundaries

2. **Unit Testing Validation**
   - Execute Jest unit tests targeting T-1.3.1 components with coverage requirements
   - Validate server/client component classification for discovered elements
   - Verify TypeScript compilation and component import functionality
   - Create unit test files for any missing test coverage
   - Ensure all components meet compilation and behavioral requirements

3. **Visual Testing & Screenshot Capture**
   - Execute Playwright-based visual testing on enhanced scaffolds to capture pixel-perfect screenshots
   - Validate screenshot generation for all 2 T-1.3.1 components
   - Verify component boundary styling (blue for server components, green for client components)
   - Confirm Tailwind CSS styling is properly rendered in visual artifacts
   - Generate high-quality PNG files for LLM Vision analysis input

4. **LLM Vision Analysis**
   - Initialize Enhanced LLM Vision Analyzer API with 60-second intervals between analyses
   - Execute component-by-component analysis for all T-1.3.1 elements
   - Validate analysis reports achieve â‰¥95% confidence scores for content verification
   - Confirm component classification accuracy through AI-powered visual validation
   - Generate detailed analysis reports for each component

5. **Validation & Reporting**
   - Compile comprehensive testing results across all phases with pass/fail status
   - Generate human-readable testing report with artifact locations and success criteria
   - Validate all deliverables including scaffolds, screenshots, and analysis reports
   - Apply fix/test/analyze cycle for any failed validation steps
   - Provide final testing summary ready for human verification

## Key Considerations

- Infrastructure focus: T-1.3.1 tests directory structure, not visual UI elements
- Real React SSR content required in scaffolds (not mock HTML placeholders)
- Component boundaries must be visually distinguishable (blue/green styling)
- 60-second delays between LLM Vision analyses prevent API rate limiting
- Legacy references guide component organization validation patterns

## Confidence Level: 9/10

High confidence due to well-defined testing phases and clear infrastructure focus. The task involves directory structure validation which is straightforward to test through file system checks and component import validation. Enhanced scaffolding system provides reliable React SSR testing capabilities.
