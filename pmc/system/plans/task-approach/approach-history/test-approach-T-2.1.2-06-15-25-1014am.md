# Testing Approach for T-2.1.2: Typography System Extraction

## Task ID
T-2.1.2

## Overview
Execute comprehensive testing of typography design tokens implemented in TypeScript, focusing on token value accuracy, TypeScript compilation, and utility function validation. Adapt standard component testing protocol for design token validation since T-2.1.2 created TypeScript tokens, not React components.

## Testing Strategy
1. **Token Discovery & Classification**
   - Analyze `typography.ts` to identify all implemented tokens (font families, sizes, weights, line heights, modifiers)
   - Validate TypeScript interfaces (FontFamilyToken, ResponsiveFontSize, FontWeightScale, TypographyModifiers)
   - Document 4 core elements (ELE-1: scale extraction, ELE-2: modifiers, ELE-3: responsive, ELE-4: type definitions)
   - Skip component scaffold generation (not applicable to design tokens)

2. **TypeScript Compilation & Type Safety Testing**
   - Execute comprehensive TypeScript compilation tests for all interfaces and types
   - Validate proper `as const` assertions for type inference
   - Test import/export functionality and module structure
   - Verify utility functions (getResponsiveFontSize, getFontFamilyCSS, generateTypographyCSS)

3. **Token Value Accuracy Validation**
   - Execute existing `typography-validation.test.ts` to validate exact token values against legacy
   - Test font size accuracy: H1 (36px/64px), H2 (32px/36px), H3 (22px/24px), H4-H6, Base (16px)
   - Validate font weights: normal (400), semibold (600), bold (700)
   - Verify line heights: tight (1.2), normal (1.33), loose (1.75)
   - Confirm letter spacing: tight (-0.3px) extraction accuracy

4. **Responsive System & Integration Testing**
   - Test xl: 1280px breakpoint system implementation
   - Validate responsive font size scaling behavior
   - Test Google Fonts URL preservation and font weight mapping
   - Confirm utility functions generate correct CSS for different breakpoints

5. **Adapted Testing Protocol Execution**
   - Skip Phase 4 visual testing (not applicable to design tokens)
   - Focus on TypeScript-specific validation phases
   - Execute comprehensive token value comparisons with legacy `_typography.scss`
   - Generate test reports focused on token accuracy and compilation success

## Key Considerations
- Design tokens require TypeScript compilation testing, not visual component rendering
- All font values must match legacy system exactly for visual fidelity preservation
- Responsive breakpoint implementation critical for xl: 1280px scaling behavior
- Google Fonts URL and weight mapping must be preserved exactly as extracted
- This is infrastructure testing - no visual UI components to test, focus on data accuracy

## Confidence Level
9 - High confidence in executing adapted testing protocol for design token system with comprehensive TypeScript validation and token accuracy testing.
