# Task Approach for T-2.5.4: Style Composition System Implementation

## Task ID
T-2.5.4

## Overview
I'll implement a type-safe style composition system using TypeScript utility functions and variant prop patterns. This approach creates reusable composition utilities, variant systems, and responsive styling for Next.js 14 components.

## Implementation Strategy
1. Create Core Style Composition Utilities
   * Build utility functions for combining CSS classes with conflict resolution using clsx and tailwind-merge
   * Implement createStyles function that accepts base styles, variant styles, and override styles
   * Add type-safe style merging with proper TypeScript generics for variant prop typing
   * Create style composition helpers for conditional styling and responsive breakpoint utilities

2. Implement Type-Safe Variant Prop System
   * Design VariantProps interface with generic typing for component variant definitions
   * Build variant configuration objects with size, color, variant, and state-based styling options
   * Create variant resolver functions that map prop values to corresponding CSS classes
   * Add compound variant support for complex styling combinations across multiple props

3. Build Component Style Override System
   * Implement StyleOverride interface allowing component-specific customizations via className props
   * Create override merging logic that preserves component defaults while applying custom styles
   * Add slot-based styling system for complex components with multiple styled elements
   * Build style inheritance patterns for consistent theming across component hierarchies

4. Develop Responsive Styling Utilities
   * Create breakpoint-aware styling functions using Tailwind's responsive prefix system
   * Implement responsive variant props that accept object notation for breakpoint-specific values
   * Add mobile-first responsive utilities following xs:475px, md:768px, lg:1024px, 1xl:1400px breakpoints
   * Build responsive style composition that maintains type safety across all breakpoint variants

5. Create Example Component Implementations
   * Build Button component demonstrating variant prop system with size, color, and state variants
   * Implement Card component showing style override system with header, body, footer slots
   * Create responsive Layout components using breakpoint-aware styling utilities
   * Add comprehensive TypeScript examples showing proper usage patterns and type inference

## Key Considerations
* Maintain full TypeScript type safety with proper generics and inference for all style functions
* Use clsx and tailwind-merge for efficient CSS class merging and Tailwind conflict resolution
* Follow P006-DESIGN-TOKENS pattern for consistent token usage across all styling utilities
* Implement responsive-first approach matching legacy breakpoint system: xs, md, lg, 1xl
* Ensure 95% test coverage with Jest, TypeScript, and React Testing Library validation

## Confidence Level
8 - High confidence. Clear requirements, familiar TypeScript patterns, established design system concepts, some complexity in type-safe variant system implementation.
