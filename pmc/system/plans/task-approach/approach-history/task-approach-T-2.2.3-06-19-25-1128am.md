# Task Approach: T-2.2.3

## Task ID
T-2.2.3

## Overview
Create comprehensive feature section documentation by analyzing the Feature.jsx component (lines 38-61) and applying T-2.2.2's proven 96.5% legacy fidelity methodology. Focus on the 3-column grid layout, feature cards with image/text structure, responsive breakpoints, and hover animations to achieve professional documentation quality standards.

## Implementation Strategy
1. **Legacy Component Analysis**: Conduct detailed analysis of Feature.jsx covering section layout structure (lines 36-37), 3-column responsive grid system (`grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3`), and container specifications (`container pb-[150px]`). Extract precise Tailwind classes, spacing patterns, and layout hierarchy for complete documentation accuracy.

2. **Feature Card Documentation**: Document card structure including dimensions (`max-w-[402px]`), styling (`bg-white p-8 shadow-nav dark:bg-dark-200`), border behavior (`border-transparent hover:dark:border-borderColour-dark`), and internal layout. Capture figure/figcaption organization, image dual-mode display (light/dark), and content spacing (`mt-10 mb-2.5`).

3. **Responsive Grid System**: Document breakpoint transitions from single column (`grid-cols-1`) to two columns (`sm:grid-cols-2`) to three columns (`lg:grid-cols-3`). Include gap specifications (`gap-8`), alignment properties (`items-center justify-center`), and responsive padding adjustments (`max-lg:p-5`).

4. **Animation and Interaction Effects**: Document hover state transitions (`transition-colors hover:transition-colors`), border color changes on hover, and dark mode image switching behavior. Capture timing specifications and visual feedback patterns for comprehensive interaction documentation.

5. **Quality Validation**: Apply T-2.2.2's proven validation methodology including direct source code verification, Tailwind class accuracy testing, and comprehensive specification documentation. Target 90%+ legacy fidelity through precise class matching and detailed measurement documentation.

## Key Considerations
- **Grid System Precision**: Three-tier responsive grid requires accurate breakpoint documentation and spacing specifications
- **Dual-Mode Image Handling**: Light/dark theme image switching must be documented with precise visibility classes and implementation patterns
- **Card Component Structure**: Figure/figcaption semantic structure with specific typography and spacing requirements needs detailed documentation
- **Hover State Complexity**: Multi-layer hover effects including border, color, and transition timing require comprehensive state documentation
- **Legacy Fidelity Standard**: Must achieve T-2.2.2's 96.5% accuracy standard through direct Feature.jsx source validation and precise Tailwind specification matching

## Confidence Level
9/10 - Very high confidence based on T-2.2.2's successful 96.5% fidelity achievement, clear Feature.jsx component structure, and established testing infrastructure. Component is less complex than navigation system but requires precise grid and card documentation.
