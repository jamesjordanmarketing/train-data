# Testing Approach for T-1.1.5

## Task ID
T-1.1.5: Layout and Metadata Implementation

### Current Approach (Added: 06/06/2025, 11:50:25 AM)

## Overview
Execute comprehensive automated testing for Next.js layout hierarchy and metadata components through 5-phase methodology: environment setup, component discovery, unit testing, visual validation with screenshots, and LLM Vision analysis to ensure proper implementation.

## Testing Strategy

1. **Environment Setup & Infrastructure**
   - Navigate to aplio-modern-1 directory and create complete test structure for T-1.1.5
   - Start enhanced test server on port 3333 and dashboard on port 3334 for React SSR testing
   - Verify all dependencies (Jest, Playwright, TypeScript, Enhanced scaffold system) are functional
   - Validate testing infrastructure before component analysis begins

2. **Component Discovery & Classification**
   - Discover all T-1.1.5 testable elements (ELE-1: Layout implementation, ELE-2: Metadata API)
   - Document findings in current-test-discovery.md with server/client classification and testing approach
   - Generate enhanced React SSR scaffolds with real content, Tailwind CSS styling, and visual boundaries
   - Validate component imports and compilation through ComponentImporter system

3. **Unit Testing Validation**
   - Execute Jest unit tests with coverage requirements (90%) for all discovered components
   - Validate server component classification (no 'use client' directive) for both ELE-1 and ELE-2
   - Ensure TypeScript compilation success and component behavior validation
   - Create comprehensive unit test files for future regression testing

4. **Visual Testing & Screenshot Capture**
   - Use Playwright to capture high-quality PNG screenshots of all T-1.1.5 components
   - Verify enhanced scaffolds render with real React content and proper Tailwind styling
   - Validate visual boundaries (blue for server components) are clearly displayed
   - Confirm all 2 expected component screenshots are successfully generated

5. **LLM Vision Analysis & Final Validation**
   - Execute Enhanced LLM Vision analysis on all captured screenshots for content verification
   - Generate detailed analysis reports with confidence scores â‰¥95% for each component
   - Compile comprehensive testing summary with pass/fail status for all phases
   - Create human-readable testing report with artifact links and validation checklist

## Key Considerations

- Both T-1.1.5 elements are server components requiring blue boundary validation and no client directives
- Layout hierarchy testing must validate nested structure and code sharing optimization patterns
- Metadata implementation requires SEO validation through Lighthouse and proper HTML head verification
- Enhanced scaffolds must contain real React SSR content, not mock HTML, for authentic testing
- Legacy code references provide implementation guidance for loading states and error handling patterns

## Confidence Level
8/10 - High confidence in executing comprehensive testing with established infrastructure and clear component specifications, though metadata SEO validation complexity may require iterative refinement.
