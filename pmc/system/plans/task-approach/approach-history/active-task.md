## Acceptance Criteria
To successfully complete this task, you must:

- Event handlers use appropriate TypeScript event types
- External library types are properly imported or defined
- Type definitions enhance developer experience
- Type safety is maintained across library integrations

These criteria define successful completion of this task and should guide your implementation work through all phases.

## Task Approach

### Current Approach (Added: 06/07/2025, 10:28:19 PM)

Overview:
Configure TypeScript with enhanced strict mode, optimize path aliases for cleaner imports, and integrate comprehensive ESLint TypeScript rules for code quality enforcement.

Implementation Strategy:
1. **Analyze Current Configuration** - Review existing tsconfig.json to identify gaps in strict mode settings and path alias optimization opportunities.

2. **Enhance TypeScript Configuration** - Enable all strict mode compiler options including noImplicitAny, strictNullChecks, strictFunctionTypes, and additional strict settings. Configure comprehensive path aliases beyond the basic @/* mapping for better import organization.

3. **Upgrade ESLint Integration** - Extend current ESLint config with TypeScript-specific rules for type safety, naming conventions, and code consistency. Add parser options and plugins for enhanced TypeScript linting.

4. **Configure Development Environment** - Set up VSCode settings for optimal TypeScript development experience with strict mode enabled, including editor validation and formatting rules.

5. **Validate Configuration** - Test TypeScript compilation with strict mode, verify path alias resolution, and ensure ESLint properly enforces TypeScript rules across the codebase.

Key Considerations:
- Maintain compatibility with Next.js 14 TypeScript integration and bundler requirements
- Ensure strict mode doesn't break existing code that may need gradual type safety improvements  
- Path aliases must work with both development and build processes seamlessly
- ESLint rules should enhance code quality without being overly restrictive for development flow
- Configuration changes must support the existing project structure and build pipeline

### Approach History

## Task Development Work Pad

As you work on this task, you may use the dedicated work pad file at:
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\pmc\core\task-work-pad-dev.md`

This work pad is your thinking space where you can:
- Work through complex implementation approaches
- Document decisions you're making and why
- Keep track of issues to revisit later
- Break down challenging problems into steps
- Test code snippets before final implementation
- Track progress across multiple components

Using this work pad is entirely optional but encouraged for complex tasks where external thinking would be beneficial. Nothing written there will be evaluated as final code - it's purely to assist your development process.

When using the work pad, start each new entry with a timestamp and brief context header to keep your thoughts organized.


## Components/Elements
### [T-1.2.4:ELE-1] Event type definitions: Define types for event handlers
  Refer to Legacy Code Reference: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\components\shared\Button.jsx:20-30` for event handlers

### [T-1.2.4:ELE-2] External library types: Import or define types for external libraries
  Refer to Legacy Code Reference: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\package.json:10-25` for external dependencies

## Implementation Process Phases
### Preparation Phase    
   - PREP Phase guidance: These Preparation Steps highlight key research and analysis activities but aren't exhaustive. Your primary goal is to prepare for complete implementation of all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Enhance these steps as needed to ensure comprehensive preparation.

1. [PREP-1] Catalog event handler patterns in the application (implements ELE-1)
2. [PREP-2] Identify external libraries requiring type definitions (implements ELE-2)

When the Preparation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.2.4 "PREP" "complete"
from the directory pmc

### Implementation Phase
   - IMP Phase guidance: These Implementation Steps outline core coding activities but aren't exhaustive. Your primary responsibility is to implement code that fulfills all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Extend beyond these steps when necessary to create a complete solution.

1. [IMP-1] Create type definitions for common event handlers (implements ELE-1)
2. [IMP-2] Implement form event type definitions (implements ELE-1)
3. [IMP-3] Install @types packages for external libraries (implements ELE-2)
4. [IMP-4] Create custom type definitions for libraries without types (implements ELE-2)

When the Implementation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.2.4 "IMP" "complete"
from the directory pmc

### Validation Phase
   - VAL Phase guidance: These Validation Steps suggest key testing activities but aren't comprehensive. Your ultimate goal is to verify that your implementation meets all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Add additional validation steps as needed to ensure complete quality assurance.

1. [VAL-1] Test event handlers with type checking (validates ELE-1)
2. [VAL-2] Verify external library type integration (validates ELE-2)

Validation Test Failure Strategy:
- Document all validation test failures with error messages and stack traces
- For each validation failure, implement fixes in the corresponding implementation file
- Rerun failed validation tests until they pass
- If a validation test cannot be fixed after 5 attempts, document the issue and proceed only if it doesn't affect critical functionality
- Log all validation test failures using the error command:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "<error description>" <severity 1-10>
  ```
  Example error logs:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Type error in button component" 7
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Critical performance issue" 9
  ```
When the Validation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.2.4 "VAL" "complete"
from the directory pmc

After completing the Validation Phase and submitting the VAL update-phase-stage "complete" command, you MUST stop and await instructions from the human operator.

## Testing Overview
Testing for this task is managed in a separate file to reduce cognitive load and ensure comprehensive test implementation.
See test mapping file: `**Test Locations**: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-modern-1\test\unit-tests\task-1-2\T-1.2.4\`
