# Task Approach - T-1.1.3

## Overview
I will validate existing Zustand persist middleware configuration in workflow-store.ts against T-1.1.3 acceptance criteria using validation-first approach. Focus on verifying auto-save triggers and session restoration work correctly with T-1.1.2 RouteGuard and progress components that depend entirely on persistent state for navigation security and progress accuracy.

## Implementation Strategy

1. **PREP Phase - Persistence Infrastructure Analysis**
   - Review workflow-store.ts Zustand persist middleware configuration to understand current persistence implementation
   - Analyze state partitioning strategy - determine which state properties should persist vs session-only for optimal performance
   - Examine T-1.1.2 dependencies: RouteGuard component requires completedSteps persistence for navigation security
   - Validate existing localStorage data structure and identify gaps against T-1.1.3:ELE-1 and ELE-2 requirements

2. **IMP Phase - Auto-save Validation (T-1.1.3:ELE-1)**
   - Test auto-save triggers across all user interactions: stage completions, form inputs, navigation events
   - Validate localStorage data integrity during stage transitions when RouteGuard and progress systems update simultaneously  
   - Test persistence timing - ensure auto-save doesn't interfere with RouteGuard redirects or progress calculation updates
   - Verify state serialization handles complex data structures (completedSteps arrays, nested form data) correctly

3. **IMP Phase - Session Restoration Testing (T-1.1.3:ELE-2)**
   - Test complete workflow resumption from any saved stage with correct RouteGuard permissions restored
   - Validate progress percentage display (0%/33%/67%/100%) shows correctly immediately after session restoration
   - Test backward navigation to completed stages works instantly after restoration without state inconsistencies
   - Verify persistence recovery handles corrupted localStorage gracefully with safe fallback to initial state

4. **VAL Phase - Cross-Component Integration Testing**
   - Execute full persistence validation across all T-1.1.2 components: WorkflowProgressClient, RouteGuard, stage pages
   - Test multi-tab scenarios and localStorage conflicts when same document open in multiple tabs
   - Validate error handling when localStorage unavailable, full, or corrupted - must not break navigation systems
   - Confirm persistence performance doesn't degrade user experience during rapid stage transitions

## Key Considerations

- T-1.1.2 RouteGuard component depends entirely on persistent completedSteps for navigation access control
- Fixed progress calculation logic from T-1.1.2 must work correctly with persistent state restoration
- Persistence failures will break both navigation security and progress tracking implemented in T-1.1.2
- Auto-save timing must avoid conflicts with RouteGuard redirects and progress updates
- State corruption recovery critical since components now depend on persistent state for core functionality

## Confidence Level
7/10 - Good confidence with proven validation approach from T-1.1.2. Persistence validation complexity and cross-component dependencies require careful testing but clear acceptance criteria provide solid implementation pathway.
