# Task Approach - T-1.1.1

## Overview
I will validate existing DocumentSelectorServer and DocumentSelectorClient components against acceptance criteria rather than building from scratch. The approach focuses on systematic verification of server component isolation, mock data rendering, client state management, and workflow navigation integration within the Next.js 14 App Router architecture.

## Implementation Strategy

1. **PREP Phase - Component Analysis**
   - Review DocumentSelectorServer structure in 4-categories-wf/src/components/server/ to verify server component implementation
   - Analyze mock data structure in 4-categories-wf/src/data/mock-data.ts to confirm document properties support validation scenarios
   - Examine client component in 4-categories-wf/src/components/client/ to understand state management patterns
   - Verify existing Next.js App Router integration and navigation patterns

2. **IMP Phase - Server Component Validation (T-1.1.1:ELE-1)**
   - Test DocumentSelectorServer renders all mock documents correctly without 'use client' directive
   - Verify async data fetching completes within 100ms simulation delay
   - Confirm proper separation of server-side rendering from client-side state management
   - Validate mock data integration displays titles, summaries, and metadata correctly

3. **IMP Phase - Client Component Integration (T-1.1.1:ELE-2)**
   - Validate DocumentSelectorClient state management for search/filter functionality
   - Test document selection logic and workflow navigation to `/workflow/{document.id}/stage1`
   - Confirm document context persistence in Zustand store integration
   - Verify client component maintains server-rendered initial data without interference

4. **VAL Phase - Acceptance Criteria Verification**
   - Verify all 3 mock documents (doc-1, doc-2, doc-3) display with proper formatting
   - Test complete document selection workflow from selection to navigation
   - Confirm workflow store receives correct document data for selected documents
   - Validate component boundaries maintain server/client separation requirements

## Key Considerations

- Components already exist and are functional - focus on validation rather than creation or modification
- Server component must operate without client-side state or 'use client' directive for proper isolation
- Mock data structure supports all testing scenarios and should not be modified during validation
- Navigation integration uses Next.js App Router with established pattern for workflow initiation
- Component architecture separation between server rendering and client interactions must be preserved

## Confidence Level
9/10 - Very high confidence since components are already implemented and tested successfully. Validation approach is straightforward with clear acceptance criteria and existing functional components.
