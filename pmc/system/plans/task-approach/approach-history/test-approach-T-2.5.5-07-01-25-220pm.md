# Current Testing Approach

## Task ID
T-2.5.5

## Overview
I will conduct CSS-specific validation testing for T-2.5.5's four CSS files (reset.css, variables.css, base.css, breakpoints.css). Testing will focus on CSS compilation, computed style validation, theme switching behavior, and responsive breakpoint verification, not React component testing.

## Testing Strategy
1. **CSS Compilation Validation**
   - Run Next.js build to verify all CSS files compile without errors
   - Check import order in globals.css for proper cascade behavior
   - Validate no CSS syntax errors or warnings in build output
   - Test CSS minification and optimization in production build
   - Verify CSS modules don't conflict with global styles

2. **CSS Variable Testing with Puppeteer**
   - Create browser tests to validate `--aplio-*` variables via getComputedStyle()
   - Test all button, card, input, and typography variables resolve correctly
   - Verify variables match T-2.5.4 composition system expectations
   - Test CSS custom property inheritance through DOM tree
   - Validate fallback values work when variables are undefined

3. **Theme Switching Validation**
   - Test CSS variable updates when `dark` class toggles on root element
   - Measure theme switching performance (<100ms requirement)
   - Verify no JavaScript re-renders needed for theme changes
   - Test theme persistence across page navigation
   - Validate all color variables update correctly between themes

4. **Responsive Breakpoint Testing**
   - Create viewport tests for all 7 breakpoints (xs:475px through 2xl:1536px)
   - Test container widths adjust at exact breakpoint values
   - Verify responsive utilities match legacy Tailwind config
   - Test touch-optimized styles on mobile viewports
   - Validate CSS Grid/Flexbox behavior across breakpoints

5. **Visual CSS Validation & DSAP Compliance**
   - Create test page at `/test-css-t255` to visually validate all CSS
   - Test typography scales, form elements, and utility classes
   - Verify DSAP button specs (30px padding, 30px border-radius)
   - Test legacy animations (bounce-open, floating) still function
   - Generate visual regression screenshots for documentation

## Key Considerations
- CSS testing requires different tools than React component testing (Puppeteer/Playwright vs Jest)
- Must validate CSS through computed styles in browser, not unit tests
- Theme switching must work via CSS cascade without JavaScript intervention
- All `--aplio-*` variables must match T-2.5.4 composition system naming exactly
- Legacy compatibility critical: FontAwesome icons and animations must work

## Confidence Level
8/10 - High confidence in CSS testing approach. Strong understanding of CSS validation requirements and browser testing tools. Minor uncertainty around legacy animation testing specifics.
