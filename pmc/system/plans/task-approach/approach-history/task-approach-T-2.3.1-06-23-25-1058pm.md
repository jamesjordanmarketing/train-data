# Task Approach for T-2.3.1

## Task ID
T-2.3.1

## Overview
Create comprehensive animation pattern documentation in `aplio-modern-1/design-system/docs/animations/entry-exit/` following T-2.2.6's successful architecture documentation approach. I will analyze legacy animation patterns from `aplio-legacy/data/animation.js` and `FadeUpAnimation.jsx` to produce implementation-ready specifications with precise timing values, duration settings, and easing functions.

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Legacy Pattern Analysis Phase**: Systematically examine animation implementations across `aplio-legacy/data/animation.js` lines 1-10 (entry), 11-30 (exit), 11-94 (sequencing), and `FadeUpAnimation.jsx` lines 6-11 to extract precise timing values, easing functions, and sequencing patterns.

2. **Documentation Structure Creation**: Establish `animations/entry-exit/` directory and create 4-5 comprehensive documentation files (9KB-15KB each) with consistent markdown structure: entry-animations.md, exit-animations.md, fade-patterns.md, animation-sequencing.md, and implementation-guide.md.

3. **Specification Documentation**: Document each animation pattern with implementation-ready specifications including exact timing values (duration/delay), easing function parameters, Framer Motion integration examples, and React component integration patterns.

4. **Visual Documentation Integration**: Include Mermaid.js animation flow diagrams for complex sequencing patterns and state transition documentation, following T-2.2.6's successful visual documentation approach.

5. **Validation and Quality Assurance**: Validate all legacy code references for accuracy, ensure comprehensive dark mode coverage, verify implementation-readiness of all specifications, and test documentation completeness against acceptance criteria.

## Key Considerations

- **Legacy Reference Accuracy**: All animation pattern references must cite correct file paths and line numbers from legacy codebase
- **Implementation-Ready Specifications**: Documentation must provide sufficient detail for AI agents to implement without ambiguity
- **Consistency with T-2.2.6**: Follow same documentation structure and quality standards that achieved 95/100 score
- **Animation-Specific Requirements**: Include precise timing values, easing functions, and frame-by-frame specifications
- **Dark Mode Coverage**: Ensure all animation patterns include comprehensive dark mode documentation

## Confidence Level
9 - High confidence based on T-2.2.6's successful documentation approach and clear legacy animation references to analyze
