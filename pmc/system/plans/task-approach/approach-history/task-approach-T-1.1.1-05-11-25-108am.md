# Task Approach for T-1.1.1: Project Initialization with Next.js 14

## Task ID
T-1.1.1

## Overview
Will initialize Next.js 14 project with TypeScript using create-next-app, establish App Router architecture, and configure essential project settings for optimal performance and development workflow.

## Implementation Strategy
1. Project Setup and Core Dependencies
   * Use create-next-app to bootstrap Next.js 14 project with TypeScript
   * Install and configure essential dependencies for development
   * Verify proper installation by running development server

2. App Router Structure Configuration
   * Configure next.config.js for App Router architecture
   * Set up essential project settings for development workflow
   * Ensure TypeScript configuration is properly established

3. Project Root Files Setup
   * Create comprehensive .gitignore file for Next.js project
   * Generate detailed README.md with project overview and setup instructions
   * Establish .env.example file with necessary environment variables

## Key Considerations
* Ensure TypeScript is properly configured with strict type checking
* App Router must replace Pages Router for modern Next.js architecture
* Configure for optimal development experience with proper linting
* Set up environment variable structure for future configuration needs
* Ensure proper Next.js 14 feature compatibility

## Confidence Level
8 - High confidence in implementing Next.js 14 project with App Router structure based on recent experience with similar projects.
