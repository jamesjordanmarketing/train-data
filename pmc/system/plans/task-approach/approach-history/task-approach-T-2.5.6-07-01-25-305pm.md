# Task Approach: T-2.5.6

## Overview
I will create a type-safe styled component system that integrates with the completed T-2.5.5 CSS foundation. The approach leverages existing `--aplio-*` CSS variables and CSS-based theme switching to provide TypeScript-safe component variants without JavaScript theme props, ensuring seamless integration with the established responsive and composition systems.

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Create Type-Safe Styled Component Foundation (ELE-1)**
   - Implement `styled.tsx` at `aplio-modern-1/components/design-system/system/` with CSS custom property integration
   - Create TypeScript interfaces that map to existing `--aplio-*` variables from T-2.5.5 variables.css
   - Build component factory pattern that generates styled components using CSS variables, not JavaScript themes
   - Reference legacy `colors.ts` lines 67-141 for type integration patterns while adapting for CSS variables
   - Ensure full type safety while maintaining CSS cascade-based theme switching

2. **Implement Discriminated Union Variant System (ELE-2)**
   - Create component variant types using discriminated unions for button, card, input, and typography categories
   - Map variant props to existing CSS variable categories (25 button, 9 card, 15 input variables)
   - Build variant resolver that applies CSS classes rather than inline styles for theme compatibility
   - Reference legacy `colors.ts` lines 77-140 for variant system patterns
   - Ensure variants work with CSS-based theme switching without component re-renders

3. **Build Style Composition Utilities (ELE-3)**
   - Create reusable composition patterns that enhance existing T-2.5.4 composition.ts system
   - Implement style merging utilities that combine CSS variable references with responsive breakpoints
   - Build component base class patterns that integrate with established 7 breakpoints (xs:475px through 2xl:1536px)
   - Reference legacy `colors.ts` lines 149-182 for composition patterns
   - Ensure composition utilities work with CSS custom properties and automatic theme switching

4. **Establish Design Token Usage Patterns (ELE-4)**
   - Create patterns for referencing CSS custom properties as authoritative design token source
   - Build token mapping utilities that connect TypeScript types to `--aplio-*` variable names
   - Implement design token validation patterns that ensure CSS variable availability
   - Reference legacy `colors.ts` lines 19-35 for token usage patterns
   - Document patterns for consuming existing CSS variables in component implementations

5. **Create Working Button Component Example (ELE-1,2,3,4)**
   - Implement complete Button component demonstrating all patterns with DSAP compliance (30px padding, 30px border-radius)
   - Showcase variant system, composition utilities, and token usage in single working example
   - Validate integration with existing CSS architecture and theme switching functionality
   - Test TypeScript safety and CSS variable integration across all breakpoints and themes

## Key Considerations

- Must use existing `--aplio-*` CSS variables, not JavaScript theme objects, to maintain automatic theme switching
- No theme props allowed - all theming through CSS cascade to prevent component re-renders on theme changes
- Integration with T-2.5.4 composition.ts system at `aplio-modern-1/styles/system/composition.ts` required
- TypeScript safety required while maintaining CSS custom property integration and responsive breakpoints
- DSAP compliance mandatory with existing button specifications (30px padding, 30px border-radius)

## Confidence Level
9/10 - Very high confidence based on clear CSS foundation from T-2.5.5, well-defined integration requirements, specific CSS variable naming conventions, and established DSAP specifications. The CSS-based approach provides clear constraints that enable robust TypeScript integration.
