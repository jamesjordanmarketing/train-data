# Task Approach for T-2.3.3

## Task ID
T-2.3.3

## Overview
Create comprehensive scroll-based animation pattern documentation in `aplio-modern-1/design-system/docs/animations/scroll/` replicating T-2.3.2's 98/100 implementation readiness success. I will analyze scroll-triggered animations, parallax effects, and trigger points from legacy FAQWithLeftText.jsx and FadeUpAnimation.jsx to produce implementation-ready specifications with Intersection Observer patterns, performance optimization, and WCAG 2.1 accessibility compliance.

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Legacy Scroll Pattern Analysis Phase**: Systematically examine scroll animation implementations in `aplio-legacy/components/home-4/FAQWithLeftText.jsx` lines 22-35 (scroll triggers, parallax effects, trigger points) and `aplio-legacy/components/animations/FadeUpAnimation.jsx` lines 6-11 (performance techniques) to extract precise scroll thresholds, viewport calculations, and optimization patterns.

2. **Documentation Structure Creation**: Establish `animations/scroll/` directory and create 5 comprehensive documentation files (15KB-25KB each, 80KB-120KB total) following T-2.3.2's successful pattern: scroll-triggered-animations.md, parallax-effects.md, progressive-reveal.md, performance-optimization.md, and implementation-guide.md.

3. **Scroll Animation Specification Documentation**: Document each scroll pattern with implementation-ready specifications including Intersection Observer thresholds, viewport trigger calculations, GPU acceleration guidelines, will-change properties, Framer Motion scroll integration examples, and progressive enhancement patterns.

4. **Performance Optimization Documentation**: Include comprehensive performance considerations for scroll-heavy animations with throttling/debouncing techniques, memory management patterns, battery optimization for mobile devices, and 60fps maintenance strategies.

5. **Validation and Quality Assurance**: Validate all legacy code references for 100% accuracy (critical requirement), ensure comprehensive dark mode coverage (50+ specifications minimum), verify WCAG 2.1 accessibility compliance with prefers-reduced-motion support, and test documentation completeness against T-2.3.2 success standards.

## Key Considerations

- **Legacy Reference Accuracy**: All scroll animation references must cite correct file paths and line numbers - 100% accuracy required for validation success
- **T-2.3.2 Quality Replication**: Must achieve 95%+ readiness score, 80KB-120KB documentation size, and exceed 50+ dark mode specifications
- **Scroll-Specific Performance**: Include GPU acceleration, will-change properties, throttling patterns, and mobile battery optimization
- **Intersection Observer Integration**: Comprehensive API usage patterns with threshold configurations and viewport calculations
- **Enhanced Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 compliance with prefers-reduced-motion queries and progressive enhancement patterns

## Confidence Level
9 - High confidence based on T-2.3.2's complete validation success and clear legacy scroll animation references to analyze
