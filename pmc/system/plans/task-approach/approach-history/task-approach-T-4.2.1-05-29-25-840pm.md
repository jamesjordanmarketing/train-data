# Task Approach for T-4.2.1: Footer Structure and Layout

## Task ID
T-4.2.1

## Overview
I'll implement a modern TypeScript server component footer by analyzing the legacy Footer.jsx structure. The approach will use semantic HTML5 footer with CSS Grid for responsive layout and exact visual match.

## Implementation Strategy
1. Analyze Legacy Footer Structure and Dependencies
   * Study aplio-legacy/components/footer/Footer.jsx for component organization and layout patterns
   * Identify FooterData import structure and data consumption patterns from legacy code
   * Extract semantic HTML structure including footer tag, container, and grid organization
   * Document all className patterns for Tailwind CSS styling and responsive breakpoints

2. Create Modern TypeScript Server Component Foundation
   * Create aplio-modern-1/components/layout/Footer/index.tsx as primary server component
   * Implement proper TypeScript interfaces for FooterData props and component structure
   * Add semantic HTML5 footer element with proper container and accessibility attributes
   * Follow P002-SERVER-COMPONENT pattern for Next.js 13+ App Router compatibility

3. Implement CSS Grid Layout and Responsive Design
   * Recreate 12-column grid layout with col-span-12 lg:col-span-6 and lg:col-span-2 breakpoints
   * Add logo section with dual theme support (light/dark variants) and proper Image components
   * Implement three footer sections: main content, navigation links, and contact information
   * Apply responsive utilities for max-lg:gap-y-10, max-lg:text-center, and mobile-first design

4. Integrate Logo, Content Sections, and Navigation Links
   * Add logo component with conditional dark/light theme rendering and proper dimensions
   * Implement footer text content with proper typography and max-width constraints
   * Create navigation link sections for "Explore" and "Resources" with hover animations
   * Add contact section with email, phone links and proper link styling with underline effects

5. Add Footer Separator, Copyright, and Legal Links
   * Implement footer separator with dual theme SVG images and responsive height adjustments
   * Add copyright section with current year display and proper flex layout
   * Create legal links section for Privacy Policy and Terms & Conditions with hover effects
   * Ensure proper spacing and alignment matching legacy py-10 and gap-15 patterns

## Key Considerations
* Maintain exact visual parity with legacy footer including spacing, typography, and colors
* Implement proper TypeScript interfaces for all data structures and component props
* Use Next.js Image component for logo with proper width/height and theme variants
* Follow CSS Grid responsive patterns exactly matching legacy breakpoint behavior
* Apply P013-LAYOUT-COMPONENT pattern for consistent layout component architecture

## Confidence Level
9 - Very high confidence. Clear legacy structure, straightforward layout implementation, familiar technologies and patterns.
