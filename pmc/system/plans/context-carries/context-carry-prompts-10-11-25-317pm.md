=========================Prompt=For=Building=Context=========================================
You are tasked with updating the context carryover file at:
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\chunks-alpha\pmc\system\plans\context-carries\context-carry-info-10-11-25-317pm.md`

First, read the entire file to understand its current structure and content.

Then, update the "Current Focus" section with the following requirements:

1. **Active Development Focus**
   - Be explicit about the task
   - Include full paths where applicable

Your task is to update: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\chunks-alpha\pmc\system\plans\context-carries\context-carry-info-10-11-25-317pm.md` with the details of what I am requesting below:

ok we have uploaded this version of the app and built it in Vercel. 

We are writing a carry over document and specification for the next chat window.
We have accomplished the current codebase in `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\chunks-alpha\src` which is working well.

The dimensions issue is fixed, and they are now being generated and are populating the front end.

We have discovered that the instructional unit chunk is processing the correct prompt. The one thing wrong though is the value being stored in steps_json is this: `[object Object], [object Object], [object Object], [object Object], [object Object]` which is not related to anything in the content file, and is obviously a data value bug (another doc did it too).

We need to fix it.
You can see the full codebase here: wireframe codebase here: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\chunks-alpha\src`

So based on the above requirements and current functionality we need to fix the bug. In this task you are giving the next coding agent the information write up needed to answer questions and help us fix the bug. 

Also I need to ask does the "Regeneration" button on the https://chunks-alpha.vercel.app/chunks/[doc-id]/dimensions/[dimension-id] page work? What does it do? Does it just regenerate the dimensions for that specific chunk? That's what it should do.


In the next carryover file: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\chunks-alpha\pmc\system\plans\context-carries\context-carry-info-10-11-25-317pm.md` write a spec to get this done. Delete any sections which are not relevant.


2. **Section Updates**
   - REQUIRED sections must always be included and fully populated
   - CONDITIONAL sections should only be included if relevant criteria are met
   - You MUST remove any sections marked CONDITIONAL if you don't update those sections because they don't have relevant content
   - Maintain consistent formatting within each section

3. **Content Requirements**
   - All file paths must be from workspace root
   - All task IDs must include both ID and title
   - All descriptions must be specific and actionable
   - All next steps must include clear success criteria

4. **Context Preservation**
   - Include any critical context from the current session
   - Reference relevant documentation and specifications
   - Maintain links between related tasks and components
   - Document any decisions or changes that affect future work

After updating the sections, review the entire file to ensure:
1. All REQUIRED sections are present and complete
2. All CONDITIONAL sections are either properly populated or removed
3. All formatting is consistent
4. All references and links are valid
5. The context is sufficient for a new session to continue the work

# Context Loading Instructions for This Development Session

## 1. Primary Context Document
REQUIRED: Carefully review the current context carryover document:
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\chunks-alpha\pmc\system\plans\context-carries\context-carry-info-10-11-25-317pm.md`

You Must Focus on:
- The ## Active Development Focus section
- Current Implementation State
- Next Steps and Implementation Plan

## 2. Technical Specifications
Review any technical specifications referenced in the "### Important Files" and "### Important Scripts, Markdown Files, and Specifications" sections of:
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\chunks-alpha\pmc\system\plans\context-carries\context-carry-info-10-11-25-317pm.md`

Key areas to understand:
- File purposes and roles
- Current state and requirements
- Integration points
- Technical constraints

## 3. Core Implementation Files
Review the implementation files listed in the "### Important Files" section of:
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\chunks-alpha\pmc\system\plans\context-carries\context-carry-info-10-11-25-317pm.md`

For each file, focus on:
- File purpose and role
- Current state
- Integration requirements
- Implementation notes

## 4. Review Process
- Read each section of `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\chunks-alpha\pmc\system\plans\context-carries\context-carry-info-10-11-25-317pm.md` carefully
- Cross-reference between context and implementation files
- Note any dependencies or integration requirements
- Identify potential implementation challenges

## 5. Development Continuity
Review the "### Recent Development Context" section of:
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\chunks-alpha\pmc\system\plans\context-carries\context-carry-info-10-11-25-317pm.md`

Focus on:
- Last completed milestone
- Key outcomes and learnings
- Technical context that carries forward
- Current development trajectory

## 5. Restate the Active Development Focus
Once you've completed this review process, please provide:
1. A summary of the active development context as you understand it from reading the: ## Active Development Focus section of the `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\chunks-alpha\pmc\system\plans\context-carries\context-carry-info-10-11-25-317pm.md`
2. Key technical considerations identified
3. Any potential implementation challenges
4. Questions or clarifications needed before proceeding
