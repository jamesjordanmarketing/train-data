=========================Prompt=For=Building=Context=========================================
You are tasked with updating the context carryover file at:
pmc/system/plans/context-carries/context-carry-info-10-05-25-227pm.md

First, read the entire file to understand its current structure and content.

Then, update the "Current Focus" section with the following requirements:

1. **Active Development Focus**
   - Be explicit about the task
   - Include full paths where applicable

Your task is to update: pmc/system/plans/context-carries/context-carry-info-10-05-25-227pm.md with the details of what I am requesting below:

Do a full review of what we accomplished in this chat window and tell the next agent that it's first job is to audit the current spec:

The next agent's task will be to audit pmc\context-ai\pmct\c-alpha-build-spec_v3.2.md because it will see that you added a section `## DASHBOARD WIREFRAME DESIGN REFERENCE`

That contains a LOT of very important reference information, but it is written outside of any coding prompt that the coding agent will see. As  the coding agent will only be given the 4 Prompts in the document. The coding agent will not read the rest of the document. 

so my questions are: 
Is there other critical knowledge or context that the coding agent will need but which are not in the prompts?

What is the best way to include critical information from the spec that is not currently in the prompts? Should we give the coding agent the entire pmc\context-ai\pmct\c-alpha-build-spec_v3.2.md file  and ask it to prompt us when it is time to submit each of the build prompts within?

Should we rewrite the pmc\context-ai\pmct\c-alpha-build-spec_v3.2.md spec to move some of the critical knowledge into the actual prompts?

Do an audit of the entire spec from the angle of making sure the prompts within it are complete and precise.

In the next carryover file: pmc/system/plans/context-carries/context-carry-info-10-05-25-227pm.md write a spec to get this done. Do not do a full analysis of the questions I just asked. The next agent will do that. Delete any sections which are not relevant.


2. **Section Updates**
   - REQUIRED sections must always be included and fully populated
   - CONDITIONAL sections should only be included if relevant criteria are met
   - You MUST remove any sections marked CONDITIONAL if you don't update those sections because they don't have relevant content
   - Maintain consistent formatting within each section

3. **Content Requirements**
   - All file paths must be from workspace root
   - All task IDs must include both ID and title
   - All descriptions must be specific and actionable
   - All next steps must include clear success criteria

4. **Context Preservation**
   - Include any critical context from the current session
   - Reference relevant documentation and specifications
   - Maintain links between related tasks and components
   - Document any decisions or changes that affect future work

After updating the sections, review the entire file to ensure:
1. All REQUIRED sections are present and complete
2. All CONDITIONAL sections are either properly populated or removed
3. All formatting is consistent
4. All references and links are valid
5. The context is sufficient for a new session to continue the work

# Context Loading Instructions for This Development Session

## 1. Primary Context Document
REQUIRED: Carefully review the current context carryover document:
`pmc/system/plans/context-carries/context-carry-info-10-05-25-227pm.md`

You Must Focus on:
- The ## Active Development Focus section
- Current Implementation State
- Next Steps and Implementation Plan

## 2. Technical Specifications
Review any technical specifications referenced in the "### Important Files" and "### Important Scripts, Markdown Files, and Specifications" sections of:
`pmc/system/plans/context-carries/context-carry-info-10-05-25-227pm.md`

Key areas to understand:
- File purposes and roles
- Current state and requirements
- Integration points
- Technical constraints

## 3. Core Implementation Files
Review the implementation files listed in the "### Important Files" section of:
`pmc/system/plans/context-carries/context-carry-info-10-05-25-227pm.md`

For each file, focus on:
- File purpose and role
- Current state
- Integration requirements
- Implementation notes

## 4. Review Process
- Read each section of `pmc/system/plans/context-carries/context-carry-info-10-05-25-227pm.md` carefully
- Cross-reference between context and implementation files
- Note any dependencies or integration requirements
- Identify potential implementation challenges

## 5. Development Continuity
Review the "### Recent Development Context" section of:
`pmc/system/plans/context-carries/context-carry-info-10-05-25-227pm.md`

Focus on:
- Last completed milestone
- Key outcomes and learnings
- Technical context that carries forward
- Current development trajectory

## 5. Restate the Active Development Focus
Once you've completed this review process, please provide:
1. A summary of the active development context as you understand it from reading the: ## Active Development Focus section of the pmc/system/plans/context-carries/context-carry-info-10-05-25-227pm.md
2. Key technical considerations identified
3. Any potential implementation challenges
4. Questions or clarifications needed before proceeding
