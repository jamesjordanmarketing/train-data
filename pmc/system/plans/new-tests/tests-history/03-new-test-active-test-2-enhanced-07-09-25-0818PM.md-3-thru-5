# T-3.3.1: Navigation Component Structure and Types - Enhanced Testing Protocol (Phases 3-5)

## Mission Statement
Execute complete visual testing, integration validation, and final reporting for T-3.3.1 navigation components to ensure foundational architecture is ready for T-3.3.2 Desktop Navigation and T-3.3.3 Mobile Navigation extension.

## Fix/Test/Analyze Cycle Pattern
For any failed validation step in ANY phase:
1. **Log Issue**: Document failure details and error messages
2. **Attempt Fix**: Apply automated correction if possible  
3. **Re-run Test**: Execute the failed step again
4. **Evaluate Results**: Check if issue is resolved
5. **Update Artifacts**: Regenerate affected files (scaffolds, screenshots, reports)
6. **Repeat**: Continue until success or maximum iterations reached (default: 3 attempts)

## Test Approach
<!-- After reading the test requirements, describe your execution approach here -->
(To be filled in by the testing agent)

## Handoff Section: Phase 1 & 2 Completion Verification

### Prerequisites for Phase 3-5 Execution
Before proceeding with visual testing and integration validation, you must verify that Phases 1 & 2 were completed successfully:

#### Step H.1: Verify Phase 1 & 2 Completion
```bash
# PURPOSE: Confirm that discovery and unit testing phases completed successfully
# WHEN: Run this as the first step before proceeding with visual testing
# PREREQUISITES: Phase 1 & 2 test plan was executed successfully
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: All Phase 1 & 2 artifacts exist and are valid
# FAILURE HANDLING: If verification fails, return to Phase 1 & 2 test plan completion

# Verify Phase 1 completion artifacts
echo "=== Verifying Phase 1 & 2 Completion ==="
echo "Checking discovery artifacts..."
[ -f "../../pmc/system/plans/task-approach/current-test-discovery.md" ] && echo "✓ Discovery file exists" || echo "✗ Discovery file missing"

echo "Checking scaffold artifacts..."
[ -d "test/scaffolds/T-3.3.1" ] && echo "✓ Scaffold directory exists" || echo "✗ Scaffold directory missing"
ls test/scaffolds/T-3.3.1/*-enhanced.html 2>/dev/null && echo "✓ Enhanced scaffolds exist" || echo "✗ Enhanced scaffolds missing"

echo "Checking unit test artifacts..."
[ -d "test/unit-tests/task-3-3/T-3.3.1" ] && echo "✓ Unit test directory exists" || echo "✗ Unit test directory missing"
ls test/unit-tests/task-3-3/T-3.3.1/*.test.* 2>/dev/null && echo "✓ Unit test files exist" || echo "✗ Unit test files missing"

echo "Checking component validation..."
[ -f "components/navigation/types/Navigation.types.ts" ] && echo "✓ Navigation types exist" || echo "✗ Navigation types missing"
[ -f "components/navigation/Navigation.tsx" ] && echo "✓ Navigation component exists" || echo "✗ Navigation component missing"

echo "=== Phase 1 & 2 Verification Complete ==="
```

#### Required Artifacts from Previous Phases
- **Discovery Documentation**: pmc/system/plans/task-approach/current-test-discovery.md
- **Enhanced Scaffolds**: test/scaffolds/T-3.3.1/ with 4 scaffold files
- **Unit Test Results**: test/unit-tests/task-3-3/T-3.3.1/ with test files and coverage reports
- **Component Validation**: All 8 TypeScript files confirmed imported and compiled

#### Continuation Context Setup
- **Implementation Location**: aplio-modern-1/components/navigation/
- **Test Server**: Should be running on port 3333 from Phase 0
- **Component Count**: 8 TypeScript files in navigation architecture
- **Testing Focus**: Foundation architecture validation with limited visual testing

## Phase 3: Visual Testing (Limited Scope)

### Prerequisites (builds on Phase 2)
- Component discovery and classification complete from Phase 1
- Unit testing complete from Phase 2
- Enhanced scaffolds generated for all T-3.3.1 components
- Test server running on port 3333
- Scaffolds contain real React content with styling

### Important Context for Phase 3
**Limited Visual Testing Required**: T-3.3.1 created foundational architecture without extensive visual components. Focus on placeholder component rendering validation and component boundary visualization.

### Actions

#### Step 3.1: Execute Enhanced Visual Testing for T-3.3.1 Foundation Components
```bash
# PURPOSE: Capture pixel-perfect screenshots of T-3.3.1 foundation components using Playwright
# WHEN: Run this after unit testing and scaffold generation to create visual testing artifacts
# DOCUMENTATION: You MUST read all of pmc/system/plans/task-approach/current-test-discovery.md because all testable elements have been documented there.
# PREREQUISITES: Enhanced scaffolds exist, test server running, Playwright installed
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: High-quality PNG screenshots captured for 4 testable T-3.3.1 components
# FAILURE HANDLING: If visual testing fails, restart test server and check scaffold accessibility

# T-3.3.1 Visual Testing Script
node -e "
const { chromium } = require('playwright');
const path = require('path');
const fs = require('fs');

async function captureT331Screenshots() {
  const browser = await chromium.launch();
  const page = await browser.newPage();
  
  const components = [
    'Navigation-enhanced.html',
    'NavigationProvider-enhanced.html', 
    'DesktopNavigation-enhanced.html',
    'MobileNavigation-enhanced.html'
  ];
  
  console.log('=== T-3.3.1 Visual Testing ===');
  
  for (const component of components) {
    try {
      const scaffoldPath = path.join('test/scaffolds/T-3.3.1', component);
      const screenshotPath = path.join('test/screenshots/T-3.3.1', component.replace('.html', '.png'));
      
      // Ensure screenshot directory exists
      const screenshotDir = path.dirname(screenshotPath);
      if (!fs.existsSync(screenshotDir)) {
        fs.mkdirSync(screenshotDir, { recursive: true });
      }
      
      // Navigate to scaffold
      await page.goto('file://' + path.resolve(scaffoldPath));
      
      // Wait for content to load
      await page.waitForTimeout(2000);
      
      // Capture screenshot
      await page.screenshot({
        path: screenshotPath,
        fullPage: true,
        type: 'png'
      });
      
      console.log('✓ Screenshot captured:', screenshotPath);
    } catch (error) {
      console.log('✗ Screenshot failed:', component, '- Error:', error.message);
    }
  }
  
  await browser.close();
  console.log('=== Visual Testing Complete ===');

# PREREQUISITES: Visual testing completed, test/screenshots/T-3.3.1/ directory exists
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: 4 PNG screenshot files confirmed for T-3.3.1 components
# FAILURE HANDLING: If screenshots missing, re-run visual testing for missing components

echo "=== Screenshot Validation Complete ==="
```

#### Step 3.3: Validate Component Boundaries in T-3.3.1 Screenshots
```bash
# PURPOSE: Verify visual boundaries are properly displayed in enhanced scaffolds
# WHEN: Run this after screenshot validation to ensure component classification is visually clear
# PREREQUISITES: Enhanced scaffolds exist with component boundary styling
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: Orchestrator components show green boundaries, provider components show blue boundaries, placeholders show gray boundaries
# FAILURE HANDLING: If boundaries missing, regenerate scaffolds with proper boundary injection

echo "=== T-3.3.1 Component Boundary Validation ==="
echo "Checking scaffold boundary styling..."

# Check Navigation (orchestrator) for green boundary
grep -l "border.*green\|#10B981" test/scaffolds/T-3.3.1/Navigation-enhanced.html && echo "✓ Navigation has green orchestrator boundary" || echo "✗ Navigation boundary missing"

# Check NavigationProvider for blue boundary  
grep -l "border.*blue\|#3B82F6" test/scaffolds/T-3.3.1/NavigationProvider-enhanced.html && echo "✓ NavigationProvider has blue provider boundary" || echo "✗ NavigationProvider boundary missing"
