# Development Context & Operational Priorities
**Date:** {{CURRENT_DATE}}
**Project:** Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1) & Project Memory Core (PMC)
**Context Version:** 3.0.0

## Introduction

This context document addresses two integrated projects that operate in tandem:

1. **Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1)**: A comprehensive modernization project converting the legacy Aplio Design System to leverage Next.js 14's App Router architecture and TypeScript. The project focuses on the Home-4 template implementation while preserving visual fidelity and enhancing developer experience.

2. **Project Memory Core (PMC)**: A structured task management and context retention system that manages the development of the Aplio project. PMC provides methodical task tracking, context preservation, and implementation guidance through its command-line interface and document-based workflow.

These projects are deliberately interconnected - PMC requires a real-world development project to refine its capabilities, while Aplio benefits from PMC's structured approach to development. Depending on current priorities, work may focus on either advancing the Aplio Design System implementation or enhancing the PMC tooling itself.

### Aplio Design System Modernization Project

#### Project Overview
This project aims to transform the existing JavaScript-based Aplio theme into a modern TypeScript-powered Next.js 14 platform. The project specifically focuses on migrating the Home 4 template (https://js-aplio-6.vercel.app/home-4) as the flagship demonstration while preserving Aplio's premium design aesthetics from the existing design system in `/aplio-legacy/`.

#### Key Documents
1. Seed Story: `pmc/product/00-aplio-mod-1-seed-story.md`
2. Project Overview: `pmc/product/00-aplio-mod-1-seed-narrative.md`
3. Raw Data: `pmc/product/_seeds/00-narrative-raw_data-ts-14-v3.md`

#### Project Objectives

##### Primary Goals
1. Migrate Home 4 template to Next.js 14 App Router architecture
2. Preserve exact design elements from `/aplio-legacy/`
3. Implement TypeScript with full type safety
4. Maintain premium design quality and animations

##### Technical Requirements
1. Next.js 14 App Router implementation
2. Complete TypeScript migration
3. Modern component architecture
4. Performance optimization

##### Design Requirements
1. Exact preservation of design elements from `/aplio-legacy/`
2. Maintenance of animation quality
3. Responsive behavior preservation
4. Professional template implementation

### Project Memory Core (PMC) System

#### Core Functionality
Everything in this section is supporting information only. Do NOT select the current task focus from this section.
PMC is a structured modern software development task management and context retention system built around the the main active task file as its central operational component. PMC is product agnostic. In this instance we are using it to code the Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1) system described above. The system provides:

1. **Context Locality**: Instructions and context are kept directly alongside their relevant tasks
2. **Structured Checkpoints**: Regular token-based checks prevent context drift
3. **Directive Approach**: Clear commands and instructions with explicit timing requirements
4. **Task-Centric Documentation**: Single source of truth for task implementation

#### Commands

The driver for most PMC commands are in:
`pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js`

The code for most PMC commands are contained within:
- The original context manager script: `pmc/system/management/context-manager.js`
- The second context manager script: `pmc/system/management/context-manager-v2.js` (created when the original got too large)
- The third context manager script: `pmc/system/management/context-manager-v3.js` (created when the second got too large)

Here are some important PMC commands:

##### Add Structured Task Approaches
```bash
node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js task-approach
```

##### Add Structured Test Approaches
```bash
node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js test-approach

#### Project Structure
```
project-root/aplio-legacy/ (legacy system)
project-root/aplio-modern-1/ (new system)
project-root/pmc/ (PMC system)

# T-2.5.4 Style Composition System - Testing Context Carryover
**Date:** July 1, 2025 09:53 AM
**Task ID:** T-2.5.4
**Implementation Status:** COMPLETE - Ready for Testing
**Testing Agent:** Next AI Agent

## Task Summary

The T-2.5.4 Style Composition System is a comprehensive type-safe style composition system that enables component variants in the Aplio Design System. This system provides utilities for creating theme-aware, responsive component styles that integrate seamlessly with the existing T-2.5.3 semantic token system and T-2.5.3a Theme Switcher. The implementation creates a modern styling architecture that preserves CSS custom property reactivity for automatic theme switching while providing type-safe composition utilities for developers.

## Critical Testing Context

### Implementation Architecture
- **Core File**: `aplio-modern-1/styles/system/composition.ts` (19KB, 626 lines)
- **Integration Method**: CSS custom property based composition using `--aplio-*` variables
- **Theme Compatibility**: Full integration with T-2.5.3 semantic tokens and T-2.5.3a Theme Switcher
- **TypeScript Safety**: Complete type safety with IntelliSense support
- **Zero Breaking Changes**: Preserves all existing Tailwind utilities and patterns

### Working Examples Implementation
The system includes complete working examples that match exact design specifications:
- **Button Variants**: Primary, secondary, outline with exact measurements (px-[30px], py-[13px], rounded-[30px])
- **Card Variants**: Default, elevated, compact matching design specifications  
- **Input Variants**: Default, large, error with proper state management
- **Responsive Typography**: Theme-aware scaling system

### CSS Custom Property Integration
All utilities output CSS custom property references (e.g., `var(--aplio-color-primary)`) rather than hardcoded values, ensuring automatic theme switching functionality is preserved.

## Testing Focus Areas

### High Priority Testing (Comprehensive Required)
- **ELE-1: Style Composition Utilities** - Core `composeStyles()`, `createStyleVariants()`, `mergeStyleCompositions()` functions
- **ELE-2: Variant Prop System** - Type-safe `createVariantSystem()`, `withVariants()` with compound variant support
- **ELE-3: Style Override System** - `createComponentOverrides()`, global registry with priority management
- **ELE-4: Responsive Style Utilities** - `createResponsiveVariant()`, `useResponsiveStyles()` hook, breakpoint integration

### Medium Priority Testing (Basic Validation)
- Theme switching integration validation
- TypeScript interface compatibility testing
- Working examples functionality verification

### Low Priority Testing (Minimal Validation)
- JSDoc documentation completeness
- Code style compliance with existing patterns

## Existing Testing Instructions Adaptations

### Modified Test Cases from active-task-unit-tests-2.md
1. **Component Discovery (Step 1.2)**: Must validate 4 elements instead of generic count
2. **Implementation Location**: Focus testing on `styles/system/composition.ts` specifically
3. **Integration Testing**: Add theme switching validation tests not in baseline
4. **Working Examples Testing**: Validate button, card, input, typography examples work correctly

### New Test Requirements Not in Baseline
1. **CSS Custom Property Output Validation**: Ensure utilities output `var(--aplio-*)` format
2. **Theme Switcher Integration**: Test composition utilities work with theme changes
3. **Type Safety Validation**: Verify IntelliSense and compile-time type checking
4. **Responsive Behavior Testing**: Validate breakpoint-aware styling utilities
5. **Real Component Integration**: Test working examples render correctly

### Eliminated Test Requirements
- Legacy pattern validation (no legacy references for this new system)
- Generic placeholder testing (specific working examples implemented)
- Theme context mocking (real theme integration already implemented)

## Modified Testing Approaches

### Integration Over Isolation
Rather than isolated unit testing, focus on integration testing with existing theme system since the value is in the integration quality, not individual function isolation.

### Real Theme Testing
Use actual theme switching rather than mocked contexts since the implementation preserves real CSS custom property reactivity.

### Working Example Validation
Test the provided working examples (buttons, cards, inputs, typography) rather than creating artificial test cases.
