# T-3.2.1: Accordion Component Structure and Types - Enhanced Testing Protocol (Phases 3-5)

## Mission Statement
Execute complete testing cycle from visual testing through final validation with LLM Vision analysis to ensure T-3.2.1 components (Accordion, AccordionItem, AccordionProvider, AccordionIcon, useAccordionAnimation) are visually correct, properly styled, and fully functional.

## Fix/Test/Analyze Cycle Pattern
For any failed validation step in ANY phase:
1. **Log Issue**: Document failure details and error messages
2. **Attempt Fix**: Apply automated correction if possible  
3. **Re-run Test**: Execute the failed step again
4. **Evaluate Results**: Check if issue is resolved
5. **Update Artifacts**: Regenerate affected files (scaffolds, screenshots, reports)
6. **Repeat**: Continue until success or maximum iterations reached (default: 3 attempts)

## Handoff Section

### Prerequisites from Phases 1 & 2
**You must verify Phase 1 & 2 completion before proceeding**:

#### Required Artifacts from Previous Phases
- [ ] **Component Discovery Complete**: `pmc/system/plans/task-approach/current-test-discovery.md` exists with all 8 T-3.2.1 components documented
- [ ] **Enhanced Scaffolds Generated**: `test/scaffolds/T-3.2.1/` contains 8 enhanced scaffold HTML files with real React content
- [ ] **Unit Tests Complete**: `test/unit-tests/task-3-2.1/T-3.2.1/` contains 6 comprehensive test files
- [ ] **Component Classification Validated**: Server components (index.tsx, AccordionIcon.tsx) and Client components (AccordionItem.tsx, AccordionProvider.tsx) properly classified
- [ ] **Test Environment Running**: Test server on port 3333, dashboard on port 3334

- **Client Components**: AccordionItem.tsx (interactive behavior), AccordionProvider.tsx (React Context)
- **Utility Functions**: useAccordionAnimation.ts (animation state management)
- **Type Definitions**: Accordion.types.ts (comprehensive TypeScript interfaces)

**Unit Test Results from Phase 2**:
- All 8 components successfully imported and validated
- Server/client boundaries properly classified and tested
- 90%+ test coverage achieved across all component files
- TypeScript compilation successful for all components

**Enhanced Scaffolds from Phase 1**:
- Real React content rendered with proper Tailwind CSS styling

```bash
# PURPOSE: Capture pixel-perfect screenshots of all T-3.2.1 components using Playwright
# WHEN: Run this after unit testing and scaffold generation to create visual testing artifacts
# DOCUMENTATION: You MUST read all of pmc/system/plans/task-approach/current-test-discovery.md because all testable elements have been documented there.
# PREREQUISITES: Enhanced scaffolds exist, test server running, Playwright installed
