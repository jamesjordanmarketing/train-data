# AI Testing Agent Conductor Prompt for T-3.2.1

## Overview

You are an AI Testing Agent responsible for conducting comprehensive automated testing for the T-3.2.1 Accordion Component Structure and Types implementation. Your primary goal is to validate that all 8 accordion components meet both functional and visual requirements while autonomously identifying and fixing issues through iterative cycles.

Your primary mission is to orchestrate the complete 5-phase testing process for T-3.2.1 using the enhanced two-file testing protocol. All test system commands are best run from the aplio-modern-1 directory. Follow these steps precisely **each time you are invoked with this prompt**:

## Step 1: Review Enhanced Testing Protocol

**Two-File Testing Structure**: The T-3.2.1 testing protocol is split into two complementary files:

1. **Phase 1-2 Testing**: `pmc/core/active-task-unit-tests-2-enhanced-phases-1-2.md`
   - Phase 0: Pre-Testing Environment Setup
   - Phase 1: Component Discovery & Classification
   - Phase 2: Unit Testing
   - Completion Report Section for handoff

2. **Phase 3-5 Testing**: `pmc/core/active-task-unit-tests-2-enhanced-phases-3-5.md`
   - Handoff Section with prerequisite verification
   - Phase 3: Visual Testing
   - Phase 4: LLM Vision Analysis
   - Phase 5: Final Validation & Reporting

**CRITICAL**: These files work together as a complete testing suite. You must execute them sequentially - complete Phases 1-2 first, then proceed to Phases 3-5.

## Step 2: Analyze T-3.2.1 Task Context

- **Task ID**: T-3.2.1 - Accordion Component Structure and Types
- **Components**: 8 total components (Accordion, AccordionItem, AccordionProvider, AccordionIcon, useAccordionAnimation, types, CSS, hooks)
- **Pattern**: P012-COMPOSITE-COMPONENT, P005-COMPONENT-TYPES
- **Server/Client Boundaries**: Optimized for Next.js 14 App Router

**Key Implementation Details**:
- Main Accordion container is a Server Component
- AccordionItem and AccordionProvider are Client Components
- Supports both single and multiple open variants
- Uses React Context for state management
- Comprehensive TypeScript type definitions

## Step 3: Review Implementation Context

**MANDATORY**: Read the implementation context from `pmc/system/plans/new-tests/02-new-test-carry-context-07-05-25-0303PM.md`

This file contains:
- Complete T-3.2.1 implementation details
- All 8 component files and their purposes
- Testing focus areas prioritized by complexity
- Success criteria and testing requirements
- Critical context for component architecture

## Step 4: Execute Two-Phase Testing Protocol

### Phase A: Execute Phases 1-2 Testing
1. **Navigate to Application Directory**: `cd ../aplio-modern-1`
2. **Load Test Plan**: Open `pmc/core/active-task-unit-tests-2-enhanced-phases-1-2.md`
3. **Execute Phases 0-2**: Follow all instructions sequentially
4. **Complete Handoff Preparation**: Verify all completion report requirements

**Critical Success Criteria for Phase A**:
- All 8 T-3.2.1 components discovered and classified
- Enhanced scaffolds generated with real React content
- Unit tests created and passing with 90%+ coverage
- Server/client boundaries properly validated
- Test environment running (ports 3333, 3334)

### Phase B: Execute Phases 3-5 Testing
1. **Verify Prerequisites**: Use handoff verification commands
2. **Load Test Plan**: Open `pmc/core/active-task-unit-tests-2-enhanced-phases-3-5.md`
3. **Execute Phases 3-5**: Follow all instructions sequentially
4. **Complete Final Validation**: Generate comprehensive reports

**Critical Success Criteria for Phase B**:
- High-quality screenshots captured for all components
- LLM Vision analysis with 95%+ confidence scores
- Visual boundaries clearly distinguishable (blue/green)
- Comprehensive testing reports generated
- All acceptance criteria validated

## Step 5: T-3.2.1 Specific Testing Requirements

### Component Classifications to Validate:
- **Server Components**: index.tsx (main container), AccordionIcon.tsx
- **Client Components**: AccordionItem.tsx, AccordionProvider.tsx
- **Utility Functions**: useAccordionAnimation.ts
- **Type Definitions**: Accordion.types.ts

### Testing Focus Areas (Priority Order):
1. **High Priority**: AccordionProvider state management, AccordionItem interactive behavior
2. **Medium Priority**: Main Accordion rendering, AccordionIcon states
3. **Low Priority**: TypeScript type checking, CSS module structure

### Expected Test Artifacts:
- 8 enhanced scaffold HTML files with real React content
- 5 high-quality PNG screenshots
- 6 comprehensive unit test files
- 5 detailed LLM Vision analysis reports
- 2 final testing reports (summary and human-readable)

## Step 6: Quality Gates and Success Validation

### Component Implementation Requirements (Must Validate):
- [ ] Component structure follows project conventions and composite component patterns
- [ ] Type definitions are comprehensive and cover all variants and states
- [ ] Server/client component boundaries are optimized for Next.js 14
- [ ] Type definitions include single and multiple open accordion variants
- [ ] Component structure enables proper composition of accordion items

### Testing Quality Gates (Must Achieve):
- [ ] **Phase 0**: Environment setup complete, all dependencies verified
- [ ] **Phase 1**: Component discovery complete, scaffolds generated with real content
- [ ] **Phase 2**: Unit tests pass, component classification validated
- [ ] **Phase 3**: High-quality screenshots captured, visual boundaries visible
- [ ] **Phase 4**: LLM Vision analysis â‰¥ 95% confidence for all components
- [ ] **Phase 5**: Complete testing documentation and human-readable reports

## Step 7: Final Reporting Requirements

After completing all testing phases, provide comprehensive status report:

### Required Deliverables:
1. **Overall Testing Status**: Pass/Fail with detailed breakdown
2. **Component Validation Results**: All 8 components with individual status
3. **Visual Test Reports**: Links to screenshots and LLM Vision analysis
4. **Interactive Scaffolds**: Working component demonstrations
5. **Test Coverage Results**: Unit test coverage metrics
6. **Human Verification Guide**: Clear instructions for manual review

### Success Metrics to Report:
- Components successfully discovered: X/8
- Unit tests passing: X/6 test files
- Screenshot quality: X/5 high-quality images
- LLM Vision confidence: X% average across all components
- Overall test coverage: X% across component files

## Important Notes

### Two-File Protocol Execution:
- **Sequential Execution**: Complete Phases 1-2 before starting Phases 3-5
- **Handoff Verification**: Use verification commands between phases
- **Artifact Dependencies**: Phase 3-5 requires Phase 1-2 completion
- **Error Handling**: Apply Fix/Test/Analyze cycle for any failures

### T-3.2.1 Specific Context:
- **Accordion Variants**: Test both single and multiple open behaviors
- **State Management**: Validate React Context implementation
- **Server/Client Optimization**: Confirm Next.js 14 boundaries
- **Visual Boundaries**: Blue for server, green for client components

### Critical Success Factors:
- Real React content in scaffolds (not mock HTML)
- Professional quality visual appearance
- Comprehensive TypeScript type validation
- Proper server/client component classification
- 95%+ confidence in LLM Vision analysis

**IMPORTANT**: Do not deviate from the instructions provided in the two enhanced test plan files. Your role is to execute the complete T-3.2.1 testing protocol diligently. This prompt serves as the standard initialization procedure for T-3.2.1 testing within the PMC system.

After completing all tests, notify the human operator with the comprehensive status report including all required deliverables and success metrics.
