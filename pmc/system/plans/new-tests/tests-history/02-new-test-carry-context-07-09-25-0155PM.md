# Development Context & Operational Priorities
**Date:** 07/09/2025
**Project:** Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1) & Project Memory Core (PMC)
**Context Version:** 3.0.0

## Introduction

This context document addresses two integrated projects that operate in tandem:

1. **Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1)**: A comprehensive modernization project converting the legacy Aplio Design System to leverage Next.js 14's App Router architecture and TypeScript. The project focuses on the Home-4 template implementation while preserving visual fidelity and enhancing developer experience.

2. **Project Memory Core (PMC)**: A structured task management and context retention system that manages the development of the Aplio project. PMC provides methodical task tracking, context preservation, and implementation guidance through its command-line interface and document-based workflow.

These projects are deliberately interconnected - PMC requires a real-world development project to refine its capabilities, while Aplio benefits from PMC's structured approach to development. Depending on current priorities, work may focus on either advancing the Aplio Design System implementation or enhancing the PMC tooling itself.

### T-3.2.4 Recent Development Context

**Task Summary**: Comprehensive testing and optimization of accordion components achieved 90% code coverage, resolved critical Jest focus management issues, and validated accessibility compliance. The task successfully transformed a partially tested component suite into a production-ready, thoroughly validated system.

**Critical Testing Context**: 
- **Jest Focus Management Crisis**: Resolved critical "Cannot set property focus" error affecting 70/81 tests through custom focus tracking system
- **Coverage Gap Analysis**: Identified and addressed coverage gaps in Accordion.tsx (22% → 90%), AccordionFocusManager.tsx (33% → 90%), and AccordionProvider.tsx (58% → 90%)
- **Performance Optimization**: Implemented memoization patterns, lazy loading, and animation optimizations while maintaining T-3.2.2's 300ms timing requirements
- **Accessibility Validation**: Comprehensive WCAG 2.1 AA compliance testing with screen reader compatibility and keyboard navigation validation

**Testing Focus Areas**:
- **State Management**: Single/multiple variant behaviors, controlled state management, event handlers
- **Focus Management**: Navigation utilities, keyboard events, focus restoration, mutation observer integration
- **Component Lifecycle**: Memoization, server-side rendering detection, performance monitoring
- **Edge Cases**: Error handling, null reference safety, concurrent state changes, memory cleanup
- **Dynamic Content**: Variable content heights, content transitions, responsive behavior

**Existing Testing Instructions Adaptations**: 
- **Environment Setup**: Enhanced Jest setup (v1.3.0) with custom focus management system replaces basic setup
- **Test Execution**: All 81 tests now execute successfully (vs. 10 before focus management fix)
- **Coverage Requirements**: 90% coverage target achieved across all components
- **Accessibility Testing**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance validation integrated into test suite

**Modified Testing Approaches**:
- **Focus Management Testing**: Custom focus tracking system without overriding read-only DOM properties
- **Performance Testing**: Memoization validation, lazy loading verification, animation performance measurement
- **State Management Testing**: Comprehensive controlled/uncontrolled state testing with event handler validation
- **Edge Case Testing**: Error boundary testing, concurrent state change validation, memory leak prevention

**Eliminated Requirements**: 
- **Visual Regression Testing**: Not required for T-3.2.4 as focus was on unit/integration testing
- **E2E Testing**: Unit and integration testing sufficient for component-level validation
- **Legacy Compatibility**: T-3.2.3 provides modern implementation baseline

**Additional Testing Needs**: 
- **Production Integration Testing**: Component integration with broader application context
- **Performance Benchmarking**: Real-world performance metrics under production loads
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Expanded browser testing for enterprise deployment

**Key Files and Locations**:
- **Test Implementation**: `aplio-modern-1/test/unit-tests/task-3-2/T-3.2.4/`
- **Component Implementation**: `aplio-modern-1/components/design-system/molecules/Accordion/`
- **Jest Configuration**: `aplio-modern-1/jest.setup.T-3.2.4.js`
- **Coverage Reports**: `aplio-modern-1/coverage-final.json`

**Specification References**:

### Project Memory Core (PMC) System

#### Core Functionality
Everything in this section is supporting information only. Do NOT select the current task focus from this section.
PMC is a structured modern software development task management and context retention system built around the the main active task file as its central operational component. PMC is product agnostic. In this instance we are using it to code the Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1) system described above. The system provides:

1. **Context Locality**: Instructions and context are kept directly alongside their relevant tasks
2. **Structured Checkpoints**: Regular token-based checks prevent context drift
3. **Directive Approach**: Clear commands and instructions with explicit timing requirements
4. **Task-Centric Documentation**: Single source of truth for task implementation

#### Commands

The driver for most PMC commands are in:
`pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js`

The code for most PMC commands are contained within:
- The original context manager script: `pmc/system/management/context-manager.js`
- The second context manager script: `pmc/system/management/context-manager-v2.js` (created when the original got too large)
- The third context manager script: `pmc/system/management/context-manager-v3.js` (created when the second got too large)

Here are some important PMC commands:

##### Add Structured Task Approaches
```bash
node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js task-approach
```

##### Add Structured Test Approaches
```bash
node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js test-approach
```
