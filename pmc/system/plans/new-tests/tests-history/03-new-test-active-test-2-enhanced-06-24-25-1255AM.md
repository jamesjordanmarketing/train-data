# T-2.3.3: Scroll-Based Animation Pattern Documentation - Enhanced Testing Protocol

## Mission Statement
You SHALL execute complete testing validation for T-2.3.3 Scroll-Based Animation Pattern Documentation from file discovery through accuracy validation to ensure all 5 documentation files meet production standards with 100% legacy reference accuracy, 60+ dark mode specifications, and WCAG 2.1 accessibility compliance.

## Enhanced Task-Specific Context

### Task Implementation Summary
T-2.3.3 successfully created a comprehensive 5-file documentation suite (~120KB total) covering scroll-triggered animations, parallax effects, progressive reveal patterns, performance optimization, and implementation guides. The implementation achieved 96/100 readiness score with exceptional quality including 100% legacy reference accuracy and 60+ dark mode specifications (20% above minimum).

### Critical Testing Requirements
1. **Legacy Reference Accuracy:** 100% validation required (CRITICAL) - Any inaccuracy fails entire test
2. **Dark Mode Coverage:** Must confirm 60+ specifications across all files (exceeds 50+ minimum)
3. **Documentation Integrity:** All 5 files must exist with correct sizes (13KB-23KB each)
4. **WCAG 2.1 Compliance:** Accessibility patterns must meet Level AA standards
5. **Implementation Readiness:** TypeScript code examples must compile successfully

## Phase 0: Pre-Testing Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
- You are in the project root directory
- You have npm and Node.js installed  
- Git bash or equivalent terminal access

### Actions

#### Step 0.1: Navigate to Application Directory
```bash
# PURPOSE: Navigate from pmc directory to aplio-modern-1 application directory
# WHEN: Execute this as the first step before any testing operations
# PREREQUISITES: You are currently in pmc directory (default shell location)
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: You will be in aplio-modern-1/ directory
# FAILURE HANDLING: If directory doesn't exist, verify you're in the correct project structure

cd ..
cd aplio-modern-1
```

#### Step 0.2: Create Test Directory Structure for T-2.3.3
```bash
# PURPOSE: Create the complete directory structure required for T-2.3.3 testing artifacts
# WHEN: Run this before any testing phases to ensure all output directories exist
# PREREQUISITES: You are in aplio-modern-1/ directory
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: All required test directories exist for T-2.3.3 validation
# FAILURE HANDLING: If mkdir fails, check permissions and available disk space

mkdir -p test/validation-results/T-2.3.3
mkdir -p test/reports/T-2.3.3
mkdir -p test/documentation-analysis/T-2.3.3
mkdir -p test/legacy-reference-validation/T-2.3.3
mkdir -p test/dark-mode-coverage/T-2.3.3
```

### Validation
- [ ] aplio-modern-1/ directory accessed
- [ ] All T-2.3.3 test directories created
- [ ] Testing environment ready for Phase 1

## Phase 1: Documentation File Discovery & Validation

### Prerequisites

```bash
# PURPOSE: Confirm all 5 documentation files exist in the correct location
# WHEN: Execute this as first validation step to ensure implementation is complete
# PREREQUISITES: You are in aplio-modern-1/ directory
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: All 5 files confirmed to exist with correct paths
# FAILURE HANDLING: If any file missing, this is a CRITICAL failure - stop testing

echo "Found $reduced_motion_count reduced motion implementations"

if [ $reduced_motion_count -gt 0 ]; then
    echo "✓ Reduced motion support documented"
