# T-3.2.2: AccordionItem Implementation - Enhanced Testing Protocol (Phases 1 & 2)

## Mission Statement
Execute complete discovery and unit testing cycle to ensure T-3.2.2 components (AccordionItem.tsx, AccordionItem.module.css, AccordionIcon.tsx, useAccordionAnimation.ts) are properly implemented, styled, and functioning with client component state management and transition animations.

## Fix/Test/Analyze Cycle Pattern
For any failed validation step in ANY phase:
1. **Log Issue**: Document failure details and error messages
2. **Attempt Fix**: Apply automated correction if possible  
3. **Re-run Test**: Execute the failed step again
4. **Evaluate Results**: Check if issue is resolved
5. **Update Artifacts**: Regenerate affected files (scaffolds, screenshots, reports)
6. **Repeat**: Continue until success or maximum iterations reached (default: 3 attempts)

## Test Approach
<!-- After reading the test requirements, describe your execution approach here -->
(To be filled in by the testing agent)

## Phase 0: Pre-Testing Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
- You are in the project root directory
- You have npm and Node.js installed
- Git bash or equivalent terminal access

### Actions

#### Step 0.1: Navigate to Application Directory
```bash
# PURPOSE: Navigate from pmc directory to aplio-modern-1 application directory where testing infrastructure exists
# WHEN: Execute this as the first step before any testing operations
# PREREQUISITES: You are currently in pmc directory (default shell location)
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: You will be in aplio-modern-1/ directory with access to test/ subdirectory
# FAILURE HANDLING: If directory doesn't exist, verify you're in the correct project structure

cd ..
cd aplio-modern-1
```

#### Step 0.2: Create Test Directory Structure
```bash
# PURPOSE: Create the complete directory structure required for T-3.2.2 testing artifacts
# WHEN: Run this before any testing phases to ensure all output directories exist
# PREREQUISITES: You are in aplio-modern-1/ directory
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: All required test directories exist for T-3.2.2 components
# FAILURE HANDLING: If mkdir fails, check permissions and available disk space

mkdir -p test/unit-tests/task-3-2/T-3.2.2
mkdir -p test/screenshots/T-3.2.2
mkdir -p test/scaffolds/T-3.2.2
mkdir -p test/references/T-3.2.2
mkdir -p test/diffs
mkdir -p test/reports
mkdir -p test/vision-results
```

#### Step 0.3: Start Testing Infrastructure
```bash
# PURPOSE: Start enhanced test server and dashboard for React SSR and visual testing
# WHEN: Run this after directory creation and keep running during all testing phases
# PREREQUISITES: npm packages installed, ports 3333 and 3334 available
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: Test server running on port 3333, dashboard on port 3334
# FAILURE HANDLING: If server fails to start, check port availability and npm dependencies

# Terminal 1: Start enhanced test server
npm run test:server:enhanced

# Wait for server startup, then verify
sleep 5
curl -s http://localhost:3333/status || echo "RETRY: npm run test:server:enhanced"

# Terminal 2: Start enhanced dashboard  
npm run test:dashboard:enhanced

# Wait for dashboard startup, then verify
sleep 3
curl -s http://localhost:3334 > /dev/null || echo "RETRY: npm run test:dashboard:enhanced"
```

#### Step 0.4: Verify System Dependencies
```bash
# PURPOSE: Ensure all required testing tools and dependencies are installed and functional
# WHEN: Run this after server startup to validate complete testing environment
# PREREQUISITES: npm is available, internet connection for package installation
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: Jest, Playwright, TypeScript, Enhanced scaffold system, and LLM Vision dependencies confirmed
# FAILURE HANDLING: Install missing packages as indicated by each check

npm list jest > /dev/null || npm install --save-dev jest
npx playwright --version > /dev/null || npx playwright install
npm list axios > /dev/null || npm install axios
node -e "require('ts-node')" || npm install --save-dev ts-node typescript
node -e "require('./test/utils/scaffold-templates/create-enhanced-scaffold.js')" || echo "CRITICAL: Enhanced scaffold system missing"
```

### Validation
- [ ] aplio-modern-1/ directory accessed
- [ ] All T-3.2.2 test directories created
- [ ] Test server running on port 3333
- [ ] Dashboard running on port 3334
- [ ] All testing dependencies installed

### Deliverables
- Complete test directory structure for T-3.2.2
- Running test server and dashboard
- Verified testing environment ready for Phase 1

## Phase 1: Component Discovery & Classification

### Prerequisites (builds on Phase 0)
- Test environment setup complete from Phase 0
- Test server and dashboard running
- Enhanced scaffold system verified in Phase 0

### Discovery Requirements:
- Find ALL testable elements mentioned in the Components/Elements section
- Name and describe each element discovered. Include the full path to it's implemented location and log those data points this file: pmc/system/plans/task-approach/current-test-discovery.md  
- Prioritize elements based on user impact and complexity
- Consider legacy references: aplio-legacy/components/shared/FaqItem.jsx

### Actions

# PREREQUISITES: Task requirements reviewed, active-task.md available, AI discovery system configured
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: Complete analysis of all testable elements logged to current-test-discovery.md with classifications
# FAILURE HANDLING: If discovery fails, review task requirements and legacy references for clarity, retry with improved prompts

# Enhanced Testable Components Discovery
# Task-Specific Context Analysis:
# - Task: T-3.2.2 - AccordionItem Implementation
# - Pattern: P003-CLIENT-COMPONENT, P018-TRANSITION-ANIMATION

# - AccordionIcon.tsx (Client Component): Icon state transitions, plus/minus switching, animation synchronization
# - useAccordionAnimation.ts (Custom Hook): Animation timing validation, height calculations, content handling

# Required Output Format for current-test-discovery.md:
# ## Testable Elements Discovery - T-3.2.2 AccordionItem Implementation
# 
# ### React Components
# - AccordionItem (Client Component): Main accordion item with expand/collapse state management, ARIA accessibility, keyboard navigation
# - AccordionIcon (Client Component): Icon component with state-based switching (plus/minus), animation synchronization
# 
# ### Custom Hooks  
# - useAccordionAnimation: Animation timing hook with height transitions, content measurement, easing functions
# 
# ### CSS Modules
# - AccordionItem.module.css: Visual styling matching legacy FaqItem, responsive design, theme support
# 
# ### Testing Priority Classification
# - High Priority: AccordionItem component (user-facing interaction), AccordionIcon transitions (visual feedback)
# - Medium Priority: useAccordionAnimation hook (supporting animation behavior)
# - Low Priority: CSS Module (styling validation through visual testing)
