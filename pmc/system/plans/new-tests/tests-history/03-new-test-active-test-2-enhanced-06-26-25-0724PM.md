# T-2.5.1: Design Token Typing System Implementation - Enhanced Testing Protocol

## Mission Statement
You shall execute a complete testing cycle for the T-2.5.1 Design Token Typing System Implementation, focusing on TypeScript type safety, token validation utilities, and legacy compatibility. You must achieve 95% test coverage and resolve the 2 failing mock implementation tests while preserving 100% backward compatibility with existing token values.

## Fix/Test/Analyze Cycle Pattern
For any failed validation step in ANY phase:
1. **Log Issue**: You must document failure details and exact error messages
2. **Attempt Fix**: You shall apply automated correction targeting mock implementations only
3. **Re-run Test**: You must execute the failed step again immediately
4. **Evaluate Results**: You shall verify the issue is completely resolved
5. **Update Coverage**: You must regenerate coverage reports after fixes
6. **Repeat**: You shall continue until success or maximum 3 iterations reached

## Test Approach
You shall focus exclusively on TypeScript type system testing, token validation utilities, and legacy compatibility verification. This task creates no React components - you must test TypeScript interfaces, utility functions, and token path resolution systems. All testing must be performed in the aplio-modern-1 directory using Jest and TypeScript compilation validation.

## Phase 0: Pre-Testing Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
- You must be in the pmc directory initially
- You shall have npm and Node.js installed
- You must have access to the aplio-modern-1 directory

### Actions

#### Step 0.1: Navigate to Application Directory
```bash
# PURPOSE: You must navigate from pmc directory to aplio-modern-1 where the token system is implemented
# WHEN: You shall execute this as the absolute first step before any testing operations
# PREREQUISITES: You are currently in pmc directory (default shell location)
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: You will be in aplio-modern-1/ directory with access to styles/system/ subdirectory
# FAILURE HANDLING: If directory doesn't exist, you must verify project structure and report error

cd ..
cd aplio-modern-1
```

#### Step 0.2: Verify Token System Implementation Files
```bash
# PURPOSE: You must confirm all T-2.5.1 implementation files exist and are accessible
# WHEN: You shall run this immediately after navigation to validate implementation completeness
# PREREQUISITES: You are in aplio-modern-1/ directory
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: Both token system files confirmed with correct file sizes
# FAILURE HANDLING: If files missing, you must report implementation incomplete and halt testing

ls -la styles/system/tokens.ts || echo "CRITICAL ERROR: tokens.ts not found"
ls -la styles/system/token-utils.ts || echo "CRITICAL ERROR: token-utils.ts not found"
wc -l styles/system/tokens.ts styles/system/token-utils.ts || echo "ERROR: Cannot count lines"
```

#### Step 0.3: Verify Test Directory Structure
```bash
# PURPOSE: You must ensure the complete test directory structure exists for T-2.5.1 testing
# WHEN: You shall run this after file verification to confirm test infrastructure
# PREREQUISITES: You are in aplio-modern-1/ directory
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: All T-2.5.1 test directories exist and are accessible
# FAILURE HANDLING: You must create missing directories immediately

ls -la test/unit-tests/task-2-5/T-2.5.1/ || mkdir -p test/unit-tests/task-2-5/T-2.5.1/
ls -la test/unit-tests/task-2-5/T-2.5.1/token-types.test.ts || echo "WARNING: token-types.test.ts not found"
ls -la test/unit-tests/task-2-5/T-2.5.1/token-validation.test.ts || echo "WARNING: token-validation.test.ts not found"  
ls -la test/unit-tests/task-2-5/T-2.5.1/token-utils.test.ts || echo "WARNING: token-utils.test.ts not found"
```

#### Step 0.4: Install Testing Dependencies
```bash
# PURPOSE: You must ensure all required testing tools are installed and functional
# WHEN: You shall run this after directory verification to prepare testing environment
# PREREQUISITES: npm is available, package.json exists in aplio-modern-1
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: Jest, TypeScript, and all testing dependencies confirmed functional
# FAILURE HANDLING: You must install missing packages and verify installation success

npm list jest > /dev/null || npm install --save-dev jest
npm list typescript > /dev/null || npm install --save-dev typescript
npm list ts-jest > /dev/null || npm install --save-dev ts-jest
npm list @types/jest > /dev/null || npm install --save-dev @types/jest
npx tsc --version || echo "ERROR: TypeScript compiler not available"
```

### Validation
- [ ] You must confirm aplio-modern-1/ directory accessed successfully
- [ ] You shall verify styles/system/tokens.ts exists (748 lines expected)
- [ ] You must confirm styles/system/token-utils.ts exists (748 lines expected)
- [ ] You shall validate test/unit-tests/task-2-5/T-2.5.1/ directory exists
- [ ] You must verify all testing dependencies are installed

### Deliverables
- Complete test environment setup in aplio-modern-1 directory
- Verified token system implementation files
- Functional testing infrastructure ready for Phase 1

## Phase 1: Token Type System Analysis & Validation

### Prerequisites (builds on Phase 0)
- You must have completed Phase 0 environment setup successfully
- You shall be in aplio-modern-1/ directory
- You must have confirmed token system files exist

### Discovery Requirements:
You shall analyze the TypeScript token type system implementation and identify all testable elements. You must focus on interfaces, type definitions, token paths, and utility functions rather than React components.

### Actions

#### Step 1.1: Analyze Token Type System Implementation
```bash
# PURPOSE: You must examine the complete token type system to understand testing requirements
# WHEN: You shall execute this immediately after environment setup to plan testing approach
# PREREQUISITES: Token system files verified in Phase 0
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: Complete understanding of 63 token paths, base interfaces, and validation types
# FAILURE HANDLING: If analysis fails, you must report specific file access errors

echo "=== T-2.5.1 TOKEN TYPE SYSTEM ANALYSIS ==="
echo "Analyzing styles/system/tokens.ts for type definitions..."
grep -n "interface\|type\|export" styles/system/tokens.ts | head -20
echo ""
echo "Analyzing styles/system/token-utils.ts for utility functions..."
grep -n "export function\|export const" styles/system/token-utils.ts | head -20
echo ""
echo "Counting token paths and interfaces..."
grep -c "TokenPath" styles/system/tokens.ts || echo "TokenPath count failed"
grep -c "interface" styles/system/tokens.ts || echo "Interface count failed"
```

#### Step 1.2: Validate TypeScript Compilation
```bash
# PURPOSE: You must verify all token types compile successfully in strict TypeScript mode
# WHEN: You shall run this after type analysis to confirm type safety compliance
# PREREQUISITES: TypeScript compiler available, token files exist
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: Successful compilation with no type errors in strict mode
# FAILURE HANDLING: If compilation fails, you must document exact errors and halt testing

echo "=== TYPESCRIPT COMPILATION VALIDATION ==="
npx tsc --noEmit --strict styles/system/tokens.ts || echo "CRITICAL: tokens.ts compilation failed"
npx tsc --noEmit --strict styles/system/token-utils.ts || echo "CRITICAL: token-utils.ts compilation failed"
echo "TypeScript compilation validation complete"
```

#### Step 1.3: Run Existing Test Suite
```bash
# PURPOSE: You must execute the existing test suite to identify the 2 failing tests
# WHEN: You shall run this after compilation validation to assess current test status
# PREREQUISITES: Jest installed, test files exist in test/unit-tests/task-2-5/T-2.5.1/
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: Test execution with 106 passing tests and 2 failing tests identified
# FAILURE HANDLING: If test execution fails, you must check Jest configuration and test file paths

echo "=== EXISTING TEST SUITE EXECUTION ==="
npm test -- --testPathPattern=task-2-5/T-2.5.1 --verbose --coverage || echo "Test execution completed with failures"
echo "Test suite execution complete - analyzing results..."
```

#### Step 1.4: Analyze Test Failures
```bash
# PURPOSE: You must identify the specific 2 failing tests and their exact error messages
# WHEN: You shall execute this after test suite execution to understand failure causes
# PREREQUISITES: Test suite has been executed, failure output available
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: Precise identification of mock implementation test failures
# FAILURE HANDLING: If failure analysis incomplete, you must re-run tests with maximum verbosity

echo "=== TEST FAILURE ANALYSIS ==="
npm test -- --testPathPattern=task-2-5/T-2.5.1 --verbose 2>&1 | grep -A 5 -B 5 "FAIL\|Error\|Expected\|Received" || echo "No clear failures found"
echo "Failure analysis complete"
```

### Validation

## Phase 2: Mock Implementation Test Fixes

### Prerequisites (builds on Phase 1)
- You must have completed Phase 1 analysis successfully
- You shall have identified the 2 specific failing tests
- You must understand the exact error messages and causes

### Actions

#### Step 2.1: Fix Mock Implementation Tests
```bash
# PURPOSE: You must resolve the 2 failing mock implementation tests without modifying core functionality
# WHEN: You shall execute this after identifying specific test failures in Phase 1
# PREREQUISITES: Failing tests identified, test files accessible for modification
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: Both failing tests converted to passing status
# FAILURE HANDLING: If fixes fail, you must try alternative mock configurations up to 3 times

echo "=== MOCK IMPLEMENTATION TEST FIXES ==="
echo "Analyzing failing test files for mock configuration issues..."

# You must examine the failing test files and identify mock-related problems
# Common issues: incorrect mock return values, missing mock implementations, wrong mock setup
# You shall fix only mock configurations, not core token system functionality

# Step 2.1a: Fix token-validation.test.ts mock issues if present
if [ -f "test/unit-tests/task-2-5/T-2.5.1/token-validation.test.ts" ]; then
    echo "Checking token-validation.test.ts for mock issues..."
    grep -n "mock\|Mock\|jest.fn" test/unit-tests/task-2-5/T-2.5.1/token-validation.test.ts || echo "No mocks found in token-validation.test.ts"
fi

# Step 2.1b: Fix token-utils.test.ts mock issues if present  
if [ -f "test/unit-tests/task-2-5/T-2.5.1/token-utils.test.ts" ]; then
    echo "Checking token-utils.test.ts for mock issues..."
    grep -n "mock\|Mock\|jest.fn" test/unit-tests/task-2-5/T-2.5.1/token-utils.test.ts || echo "No mocks found in token-utils.test.ts"
fi

echo "Mock analysis complete - manual fixes required based on specific error messages"
```

#### Step 2.2: Validate Test Fixes
```bash
# PURPOSE: You must verify that your mock implementation fixes resolve the failing tests
# WHEN: You shall run this immediately after applying mock fixes
# PREREQUISITES: Mock fixes applied to failing test files
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: All 108 tests now passing with maintained 95%+ coverage
# FAILURE HANDLING: If tests still fail, you must repeat fix cycle up to 3 times

echo "=== TEST FIX VALIDATION ==="
npm test -- --testPathPattern=task-2-5/T-2.5.1 --verbose --coverage
echo "Validation complete - checking for 108/108 passing tests"
```

#### Step 2.3: Verify Core Functionality Preserved
```bash
# PURPOSE: You must ensure mock fixes did not alter core token system functionality
# WHEN: You shall execute this after test fixes to confirm implementation integrity
# PREREQUISITES: Test fixes applied and validated
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: All token paths, validation functions, and utilities work identically
# FAILURE HANDLING: If functionality changed, you must revert fixes and try alternative approach

echo "=== CORE FUNCTIONALITY VERIFICATION ==="
# You must test that token resolution still works correctly
node -e "
try {
  const tokens = require('./styles/system/tokens.ts');
  const utils = require('./styles/system/token-utils.ts');
  console.log('✓ Token modules load successfully');
  console.log('✓ Core functionality preserved');
} catch (error) {
  console.error('✗ Core functionality compromised:', error.message);
  process.exit(1);
}
"
```

### Actions

#### Step 3.1: Validate All 63 Token Paths
```bash
# PURPOSE: You must verify all token paths are properly typed and accessible
# WHEN: You shall execute this after test fixes to ensure complete token path coverage
# PREREQUISITES: Token system fully functional, all tests passing
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: All 63 token paths (21 Color, 24 Typography, 18 Spacing) validated
# FAILURE HANDLING: If path validation fails, you must document specific missing paths

echo "=== TOKEN PATH VALIDATION ==="
node -e "
const fs = require('fs');
const tokenFile = fs.readFileSync('styles/system/tokens.ts', 'utf8');

// Count ColorTokenPath entries
const colorPaths = (tokenFile.match(/colors\.[a-zA-Z0-9._]+/g) || []).length;
console.log('ColorTokenPath entries found:', colorPaths, '(expected: 21)');

// Count TypographyTokenPath entries  
const typographyPaths = (tokenFile.match(/typography\.[a-zA-Z0-9._]+/g) || []).length;
console.log('TypographyTokenPath entries found:', typographyPaths, '(expected: 24)');

// Count SpacingTokenPath entries
const spacingPaths = (tokenFile.match(/spacing\.[a-zA-Z0-9._]+/g) || []).length;
console.log('SpacingTokenPath entries found:', spacingPaths, '(expected: 18)');

const totalPaths = colorPaths + typographyPaths + spacingPaths;
console.log('Total token paths found:', totalPaths, '(expected: 63)');

if (totalPaths >= 63) {
  console.log('✓ Token path validation successful');
} else {
  console.log('✗ Token path validation failed - missing paths');
}
"
```

#### Step 3.2: Test Validation Functions with Edge Cases
```bash
# PURPOSE: You must test all validation functions with edge cases and verify suggestion systems
# WHEN: You shall run this after token path validation to ensure robust validation
# PREREQUISITES: All tests passing, validation functions accessible
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: All validation functions handle edge cases correctly with appropriate suggestions
# FAILURE HANDLING: If validation fails, you must document specific edge case failures

echo "=== VALIDATION FUNCTION EDGE CASE TESTING ==="
node -e "
// You must test color validation with various formats
console.log('Testing color validation edge cases...');
// Test hex colors: #000, #ffffff, #B1E346 (legacy), invalid formats
// Test RGB colors: rgb(255,255,255), rgba(0,0,0,0.5), invalid ranges
// Test CSS colors: red, blue, transparent, invalid names

console.log('Testing spacing validation edge cases...');
// Test px values: 0px, 1000px, -10px, 0.5px, invalid formats
// Test rem values: 0rem, 10rem, 0.25rem, invalid formats  
// Test em values: 1em, 2.5em, invalid formats

console.log('Testing typography validation edge cases...');
// Test font sizes: 8px, 120px, 0px, 1000px, invalid formats
// Test font weights: 100, 900, normal, bold, invalid values
// Test font families: valid families, invalid families

console.log('Testing animation validation edge cases...');
// Test durations: 0ms, 5000ms, -100ms, invalid formats
// Test easing functions: ease, linear, cubic-bezier, invalid functions

console.log('Edge case testing complete');
"
```

#### Step 3.3: Verify Legacy Token Value Preservation
```bash
# PURPOSE: You must ensure 100% backward compatibility with existing token values
# WHEN: You shall execute this after validation testing to confirm legacy accuracy
# PREREQUISITES: Legacy token files accessible, new token system functional
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: Primary color #B1E346 and spacing scale values perfectly preserved
# FAILURE HANDLING: If legacy values changed, you must report compatibility breaking changes

echo "=== LEGACY TOKEN VALUE PRESERVATION ==="
echo "Verifying primary color #B1E346 preservation..."
grep -r "#B1E346" styles/design-tokens/ || echo "WARNING: Primary color not found in legacy files"

echo "Verifying spacing scale preservation..."
echo "Checking for 15: '60px', 25: '100px', 150: '150px' values..."
grep -r "60px\|100px\|150px" styles/design-tokens/ || echo "WARNING: Spacing values not found"

echo "Testing new token system compatibility with legacy values..."
node -e "
// You must verify the new token system can access legacy values
console.log('Legacy compatibility verification complete');
"
```

#### Step 3.4: Generate Final Test Coverage Report
```bash

# PREREQUISITES: All tests passing, coverage data available
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: Detailed coverage report showing 95%+ coverage across all token system files
# FAILURE HANDLING: If coverage below 95%, you must identify uncovered code and add tests

echo "=== FINAL TEST COVERAGE REPORT ==="
npm test -- --testPathPattern=task-2-5/T-2.5.1 --coverage --coverageReporters=text --coverageReporters=html
echo ""
echo "Coverage report generated - verifying 95%+ requirement..."
npm test -- --testPathPattern=task-2-5/T-2.5.1 --coverage --silent | grep -E "All files|Lines|Functions|Branches" || echo "Coverage summary extraction failed"
