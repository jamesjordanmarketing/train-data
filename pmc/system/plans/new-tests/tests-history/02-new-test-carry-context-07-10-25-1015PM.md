# Development Context & Operational Priorities
**Date:** 2025-07-10 22:22 PST
**Project:** Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1) & Project Memory Core (PMC)
**Context Version:** 3.0.0

## Introduction

This context document addresses two integrated projects that operate in tandem:

1. **Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1)**: A comprehensive modernization project converting the legacy Aplio Design System to leverage Next.js 14's App Router architecture and TypeScript. The project focuses on the Home-4 template implementation while preserving visual fidelity and enhancing developer experience.

2. **Project Memory Core (PMC)**: A structured task management and context retention system that manages the development of the Aplio project. PMC provides methodical task tracking, context preservation, and implementation guidance through its command-line interface and document-based workflow.

These projects are deliberately interconnected - PMC requires a real-world development project to refine its capabilities, while Aplio benefits from PMC's structured approach to development. Depending on current priorities, work may focus on either advancing the Aplio Design System implementation or enhancing the PMC tooling itself.

## Current Focus

### T-3.3.2 Active Testing Focus

**What is being tested:** T-3.3.2 Desktop Navigation Implementation - A complete desktop navigation component with dropdown functionality, mega menus, active state detection, and comprehensive accessibility features built upon the validated T-3.3.1 foundation architecture.

**Why it is being tested:** This task represents the first visual implementation building on the T-3.3.1 foundation architecture (530+ lines of TypeScript interfaces, 8 validated TypeScript files). The desktop navigation component is a critical user-facing element that requires comprehensive testing to ensure visual fidelity with legacy design, proper functionality of dropdown interactions, accessibility compliance, and seamless integration with the validated foundation hooks and state management.

**Current state of implementation:** COMPLETED - All three phases (PREP, IMP, VAL) have been successfully finished. The implementation includes:
- Complete DesktopNavigation.tsx component (300+ lines) with full dropdown and mega menu functionality
- Integration with validated T-3.3.1 hooks (useNavigationState, useStickyNavigation) 
- 15 comprehensive test cases created in DesktopNavigation.test.tsx
- 100% DSAP compliance report completed
- Visual fidelity maintained with legacy PrimaryNavbar.jsx component
- TypeScript compilation errors resolved (cn utility created, interface properties added)

**Critical context needed for testing:** The implementation leveraged the complete T-3.3.1 foundation architecture without recreating any foundational elements. All TypeScript interfaces, hooks, and architectural patterns from T-3.3.1 are extensively used. The component maintains exact visual styling from the legacy implementation while providing modern TypeScript safety and Next.js 14 optimization patterns.

Do not deviate from this focus without explicit instruction.
All other information in this document is reference material only.

## Testing Focus Areas

You must focus testing scrutiny on these areas because they are new, complex, or high-risk:

• **Dropdown State Management** - Complex interaction between useNavigationState hook and dropdown open/close animations with outside click detection
• **Mega Menu Grid Layout** - 12-column grid layout with image display and 3-column submenu items requiring responsive behavior validation  
• **Active State Detection** - Pathname-based active state logic with legacy compatibility for home/page title matching
• **Animation Timing Fidelity** - All animations must match legacy duration-500 timing with smooth scale-y-0 to scale-y-100 transitions
• **Foundation Hook Integration** - Proper integration with T-3.3.1 useNavigationState and useStickyNavigation hooks without breaking existing patterns
• **Accessibility Implementation** - Comprehensive ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support following NavigationAccessibilityConfig

## Existing Testing Instructions Adaptations

The baseline unit-test file pmc/core/active-task-unit-tests-2.md requires these critical adaptations:

**NEW TEST CASES REQUIRED:**
- Mega menu functionality testing (not covered in baseline)
- Visual animation timing validation (duration-500 requirement)
- Foundation hook integration testing (T-3.3.1 hooks usage)
- Custom render function testing (renderItem, renderDropdown, renderMegaMenu props)
- Accessibility configuration testing (NavigationAccessibilityConfig interface)

**MODIFIED ASSERTIONS:**
- Component import path changed to `../../../lib/utils/cn` (cn utility created)
- Interface properties added: `'data-testid'` and `id` properties now included in DesktopNavigationProps
- Active state logic updated to include both pathname matching and legacy title-based detection

**REMOVED TESTING REQUIREMENTS:**
- Component path resolution issues from T-3.3.1 have been fixed - no longer need to test for import failures
- Foundation architecture creation testing (already validated in T-3.3.1)
- Basic TypeScript interface testing (comprehensive interfaces already proven)

## Modified Testing Approaches

**Visual Testing Enhancement:** Unlike T-3.3.1's architectural focus, T-3.3.2 requires functional UI testing with screenshot comparison against legacy PrimaryNavbar component. Test scaffolds must generate functional components, not error boundaries.

**Integration Testing Focus:** Test the integration with T-3.3.1 foundation architecture rather than testing the foundation itself. Validate that hooks are properly used and state management works correctly.

**Animation Performance Testing:** Use the enhanced testing infrastructure to validate 60fps dropdown animations and proper CSS transform usage for optimal performance.

## Additional Testing Needs

These fresh test scenarios became necessary due to the actual implementation approach:

• **cn Utility Function Testing** - New TypeScript class name utility created at `aplio-modern-1/lib/utils/cn.ts` requires basic functionality testing
• **Logo Click Handler Testing** - onLogoClick functionality implemented but not covered in baseline tests
• **Search Toggle State Management** - Local search state (showSearch) requires testing for proper toggle behavior
• **Custom Accessibility Configuration** - NavigationAccessibilityConfig interface usage requires validation testing
• **Outside Click Detection** - Dropdown closure on outside clicks requires DOM event simulation testing
• **Keyboard Navigation Integration** - Escape key handling through useNavigationState hook requires comprehensive keyboard testing
