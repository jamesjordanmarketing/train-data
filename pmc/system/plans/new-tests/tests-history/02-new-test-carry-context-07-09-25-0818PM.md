# Development Context & Operational Priorities
**Date:** 07/09/2025
**Project:** Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1) & Project Memory Core (PMC)
**Context Version:** 3.0.0

## Introduction

This context document addresses two integrated projects that operate in tandem:

1. **Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1)**: A comprehensive modernization project converting the legacy Aplio Design System to leverage Next.js 14's App Router architecture and TypeScript. The project focuses on the Home-4 template implementation while preserving visual fidelity and enhancing developer experience.

2. **Project Memory Core (PMC)**: A structured task management and context retention system that manages the development of the Aplio project. PMC provides methodical task tracking, context preservation, and implementation guidance through its command-line interface and document-based workflow.

These projects are deliberately interconnected - PMC requires a real-world development project to refine its capabilities, while Aplio benefits from PMC's structured approach to development. Depending on current priorities, work may focus on either advancing the Aplio Design System implementation or enhancing the PMC tooling itself.

## Current Focus

### T-3.3.1 Active Testing Focus

**What is being tested**: T-3.3.1 Navigation Component Structure and Types - the foundational architecture for navigation components in the Aplio Design System modernization project.

**Why it is being tested**: This task established the core navigation component architecture that will be extended by T-3.3.2 Desktop Navigation and T-3.3.3 Mobile Navigation. The foundation includes comprehensive TypeScript interfaces, client/server boundary optimization, and modular component structure. Testing ensures the architecture is sound, types are comprehensive, and the foundation is ready for extension.

**Current state of implementation**: COMPLETED - All three phases (PREP, IMP, VAL) successfully completed with PMC CLI confirmations. Created 8 TypeScript implementation files establishing comprehensive navigation component foundation.

**Critical context needed for continuation**: The implementation leveraged T-3.2.4 accordion patterns for consistency and analyzed legacy navigation structure from `aplio-legacy/components/navbar/PrimaryNavbar.jsx`. All files created follow Next.js 14 App Router patterns with strategic client/server boundaries and 100% DSAP compliance.

### Testing Focus Areas

**High Priority Testing Requirements**:
- **Navigation.types.ts** (400+ lines): Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces requiring thorough type coverage validation
- **useNavigationState.ts**: State management hook with dropdown, mobile menu, search, and sticky state requiring state transition testing
- **useStickyNavigation.ts**: Performance-optimized scroll handling requiring performance validation
- **Navigation.tsx**: Main orchestrator component requiring client/server boundary testing
- **NavigationProvider.tsx**: Context provider with multiple hooks requiring context functionality testing

**Medium Priority Testing Requirements**:
- **DesktopNavigation.tsx**: Foundation placeholder requiring basic import/export validation
- **MobileNavigation.tsx**: Foundation placeholder requiring basic import/export validation
- **index.tsx**: Barrel export file requiring export structure validation

### Existing Testing Instructions Adaptations

**Baseline Test Plan**: `pmc/core/active-task-unit-tests-2.md` contains comprehensive 5-phase testing protocol.

**Required Adaptations**:
- **Phase 1 Discovery**: Focus on 8 created TypeScript files in `aplio-modern-1/components/navigation/` directory structure
- **Phase 2 Unit Testing**: Emphasize TypeScript interface validation, hook testing, and provider context testing
- **Phase 3 Visual Testing**: Limited visual testing needed as this is foundational architecture (no visual components implemented)
- **Phase 4 Integration Testing**: Focus on component integration within navigation architecture
- **Phase 5 Reporting**: Include DSAP compliance validation and type coverage metrics

**New Test Cases Required**:
- Navigation variant system validation (5 variant types implemented)
- State management hook testing with mock implementations
- Sticky navigation performance optimization verification
- Client/server boundary validation for Next.js 14 App Router

### Modified Testing Approaches

**TypeScript Interface Testing**: Enhanced focus on comprehensive type coverage due to 400+ lines of type definitions including Navigation variant system, data structures, configuration interfaces, and component props.

**Hook Testing**: Specialized testing required for custom hooks (`useNavigationState`, `useStickyNavigation`) with mock implementations for state management and performance optimization.

**Architecture Validation**: Testing must validate the modular architecture with proper directory structure, barrel exports, and component integration patterns.

### Eliminated Requirements

**Visual Component Testing**: Original test plan may include extensive visual component testing, but T-3.3.1 created foundational architecture without visual components. Visual testing should be minimal and focused on placeholder components only.

**Legacy Integration Testing**: While legacy analysis was performed during implementation, extensive legacy integration testing is not required as T-3.3.1 establishes new modern architecture.

### Additional Testing Needs

**Performance Testing**: Sticky navigation hook requires performance validation not covered in baseline test plan.

**Context Provider Testing**: Navigation provider with multiple convenience hooks requires specialized context testing approaches.

**Type Safety Validation**: Comprehensive validation of TypeScript interfaces, type utilities, and validation functions requires specialized type testing.

**Next.js 14 Optimization Testing**: Client/server boundary testing specific to Next.js 14 App Router patterns requires specialized validation.
