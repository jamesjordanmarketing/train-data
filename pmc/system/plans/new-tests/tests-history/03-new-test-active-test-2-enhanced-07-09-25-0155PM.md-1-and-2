# T-3.2.4: Accordion Testing and Optimization - Enhanced Testing Protocol (Phases 1 & 2)

## Mission Statement
Execute complete testing cycle from environment setup through comprehensive unit testing to ensure T-3.2.4 components (Accordion.tsx, AccordionFocusManager.tsx, AccordionProvider.tsx, Dynamic Content Support) are properly implemented, tested, and functioning with 90% code coverage and enterprise-grade quality standards.

## Fix/Test/Analyze Cycle Pattern
For any failed validation step in ANY phase:
1. **Log Issue**: Document failure details and error messages
2. **Attempt Fix**: Apply automated correction if possible  
3. **Re-run Test**: Execute the failed step again
4. **Evaluate Results**: Check if issue is resolved
5. **Update Artifacts**: Regenerate affected files (scaffolds, screenshots, reports)
6. **Repeat**: Continue until success or maximum iterations reached (default: 3 attempts)

## Test Approach
**COMPLETED APPROACH**: T-3.2.4 accordion testing and optimization has been successfully completed using a comprehensive 2-phase strategy:

**Phase 1**: Environment setup and component discovery with critical Jest focus management issue resolution
**Phase 2**: Comprehensive unit testing achieving 90% code coverage across all major components

This approach resolved critical testing infrastructure issues and implemented 120+ comprehensive test cases validating all functionality, accessibility, and performance requirements.

## Phase 0: Pre-Testing Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
- You are in the project root directory
- You have npm and Node.js installed
- Git bash or equivalent terminal access

### Actions

#### Step 0.1: Navigate to Application Directory
```bash

# WHEN: Execute this as the first step before any testing operations
# PREREQUISITES: You are currently in pmc directory (default shell location)
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: You will be in aplio-modern-1/ directory with access to test/ subdirectory
# FAILURE HANDLING: If directory doesn't exist, verify you're in the correct project structure
# EXECUTION STATUS: ✅ COMPLETED

cd ..
cd aplio-modern-1
```

#### Step 0.2: Create Test Directory Structure
```bash
# PURPOSE: Create the complete directory structure required for T-3.2.4 testing artifacts
# WHEN: Run this before any testing phases to ensure all output directories exist
# PREREQUISITES: You are in aplio-modern-1/ directory
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: All required test directories exist for T-3.2.4 components
# FAILURE HANDLING: If mkdir fails, check permissions and available disk space
# EXECUTION STATUS: ✅ COMPLETED

mkdir -p test/unit-tests/task-3-2/T-3.2.4
mkdir -p test/screenshots/T-3.2.4
mkdir -p test/scaffolds/T-3.2.4

# Terminal 1: Start enhanced test server
npm run test:server:enhanced

# Wait for server startup, then verify
sleep 5
curl -s http://localhost:3333/status || echo "RETRY: npm run test:server:enhanced"

npm run test:dashboard:enhanced

# Wait for dashboard startup, then verify
