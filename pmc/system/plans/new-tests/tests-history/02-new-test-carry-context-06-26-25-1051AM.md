# Development Context & Operational Priorities
**Date:** 2025-01-26
**Project:** Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1) & Project Memory Core (PMC)
**Context Version:** 3.0.0

## Introduction

This context document addresses two integrated projects that operate in tandem:

1. **Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1)**: A comprehensive modernization project converting the legacy Aplio Design System to leverage Next.js 14's App Router architecture and TypeScript. The project focuses on the Home-4 template implementation while preserving visual fidelity and enhancing developer experience.

2. **Project Memory Core (PMC)**: A structured task management and context retention system that manages the development of the Aplio project. PMC provides methodical task tracking, context preservation, and implementation guidance through its command-line interface and document-based workflow.

These projects are deliberately interconnected - PMC requires a real-world development project to refine its capabilities, while Aplio benefits from PMC's structured approach to development. Depending on current priorities, work may focus on either advancing the Aplio Design System implementation or enhancing the PMC tooling itself.

## Current Focus

### T-2.4.6 Active Testing Focus

**What is being tested**: Comprehensive responsive typography documentation system (91.3KB across 5 files) created for the Aplio Design System modernization. The documentation covers responsive font sizing strategy, typographic scale implementation across breakpoints, line length and spacing considerations, and typographic hierarchy patterns for responsive layouts.

**Why it is being tested**: This documentation system serves as the foundational reference for all typography-related component implementations in the design system. It achieved 100% legacy pattern accuracy and WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance. Testing validates that the documentation provides accurate guidance, comprehensive coverage, and usable implementation patterns for future coding agents.

**Current state of implementation**: COMPLETE - All three phases finished with high confidence:
- ✅ PREP Phase: Legacy typography patterns analyzed from `_typography.scss:16-31`
- ✅ IMP Phase: 5-file documentation structure created (91.3KB total)
- ✅ VAL Phase: 100% accuracy validation against legacy patterns completed

**Critical context for continuation**: The documentation follows the proven T-2.4.5 success pattern (109KB total) and implements responsive scaling patterns: H1 (36px→64px at xl breakpoint), H2 (32px→36px), H3 (22px→24px), body text with font-Inter, leading-[1.75], -tracking-[0.3px]. All patterns extracted from legacy `aplio-legacy/scss/_typography.scss:16-31`.

### Next Steps 

1. **TEST-VALIDATION-01**: Validate documentation accuracy against legacy implementation patterns in `_typography.scss:16-31`
2. **TEST-INTEGRATION-02**: Test TypeScript interfaces and code examples for compilation in Next.js 14 environment
3. **TEST-ACCESSIBILITY-03**: Verify WCAG 2.1 AA compliance claims through accessibility testing tools
4. **TEST-USABILITY-04**: Validate that coding agents can successfully implement components using this documentation
5. **TEST-COMPLETENESS-05**: Ensure all 5 files provide comprehensive coverage of responsive typography requirements

### T-2.4.6 Recent Development Context

- **Last Milestone**: All three phases (PREP, IMP, VAL) completed successfully with 10/10 confidence ratings
- **Key Outcomes**: 91.3KB comprehensive typography documentation created following proven T-2.4.5 pattern
- **Relevant Learnings**: Typography patterns exactly match legacy implementation with verified 100% accuracy
- **Technical Context**: Documentation implements TypeScript strict mode compatibility and WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards

## Testing Focus Areas

### High Priority Testing Requirements

1. **Legacy Pattern Accuracy**: Validate 100% accuracy claim against `_typography.scss:16-31` patterns
2. **TypeScript Compilation**: Test all code examples compile successfully in Next.js 14 environment
3. **WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance**: Verify accessibility standards implementation through automated testing
4. **Documentation Completeness**: Ensure all 4 acceptance criteria are fully addressed
5. **Implementation Usability**: Test that coding agents can successfully use documentation for component implementation

### Critical Testing Context

**Implementation completed using proven T-2.4.5 pattern**: The 5-file structure (typography-definitions.md, typography-implementation-guidelines.md, typography-constraints-specifications.md, typography-testing-guide.md, typography-visual-reference.md) exactly replicates the successful approach from T-2.4.5 which achieved comprehensive coverage and high accuracy.

**Legacy reference validation critical**: All typography patterns must exactly match the implementations in `aplio-legacy/scss/_typography.scss:16-31`. Any deviation from these patterns would break design system consistency.

**Responsive scaling verification essential**: The documentation claims specific scaling behavior (H1: 36px→64px, H2: 32px→36px, H3: 22px→24px) that must be validated through breakpoint testing.

### Existing Testing Instructions Adaptations

**Modifications to baseline unit-test file**:
1. **Add legacy validation tests**: Test accuracy against `_typography.scss:16-31` patterns not included in baseline
2. **Include accessibility validation**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance testing for typography not in baseline plan
3. **Add documentation usability tests**: Test coding agent workflow using documentation not covered in baseline
4. **Include TypeScript compilation tests**: Verify all code examples compile in Next.js 14 environment
5. **Add visual regression tests**: Test responsive scaling behavior across breakpoints

**Modified Testing Approaches**:
- **Documentation testing approach**: Focus on content accuracy and usability rather than component functionality
- **Legacy comparison testing**: Direct pattern matching against source files
- **Accessibility testing integration**: Automated WCAG validation of documented standards
- **Agent workflow testing**: Test documentation usability for implementation tasks

### Additional Testing Needs

1. **Cross-reference validation**: Test links and references between the 5 documentation files for accuracy
2. **Performance specification validation**: Verify claimed performance metrics are achievable
3. **Browser compatibility testing**: Validate typography patterns work across specified browser matrix
4. **Font loading optimization testing**: Test documented font loading strategies for performance
5. **Semantic relationship testing**: Validate typography documentation integrates correctly with layout and component documentation
