## Introduction

This context document addresses the testing context for T-2.3.3: Scroll-Based Animation Pattern Documentation, a critical component of the Aplio Design System Modernization project. T-2.3.3 has been successfully implemented and requires comprehensive testing validation to ensure production readiness.

The task involved creating comprehensive scroll-based animation documentation that replicates the exceptional success pattern from T-2.3.2 (98/100 implementation readiness score) while addressing scroll-specific animation requirements including Intersection Observer API integration, performance optimization, and accessibility compliance.

## Current Focus

### T-2.3.3 Active Testing Focus

**What is being tested:**

## Existing Testing Instructions Adaptations

The baseline test plan in `pmc/core/active-task-unit-tests-2.md` must be enhanced with the following T-2.3.3-specific adaptations:

### Required Test Case Additions
1. **Legacy Reference Accuracy Testing:** Add specific validation tests for `aplio-legacy/components/home-4/FAQWithLeftText.jsx` lines 22-35 and `aplio-legacy/components/animations/FadeUpAnimation.jsx` lines 6-11 references
2. **Dark Mode Coverage Counting:** Implement automated dark mode specification counting across all 5 documentation files
3. **Documentation Size Validation:** Add file size verification tests for individual files (13KB-23KB) and total size (~120KB)
4. **WCAG 2.1 Compliance Testing:** Add accessibility validation tests for reduced motion patterns and screen reader support

### Modified Testing Approaches
- **File Discovery Enhancement:** Modify component discovery to focus on documentation files rather than React components
- **Validation Strategy Adaptation:** Shift from interactive component testing to content validation and accuracy testing
- **Performance Testing Focus:** Emphasize documentation of performance patterns rather than runtime performance testing

## Eliminated Requirements

### Obsolete Testing Requirements from Baseline
- **Interactive Component Testing:** T-2.3.3 produces documentation files, not interactive components

## Additional Testing Needs

### Fresh Test Scenarios Required
1. **Documentation Content Accuracy Validation:** Verify technical accuracy of all scroll animation patterns and code examples
2. **Cross-Reference Validation:** Ensure all internal documentation links and references are accurate and functional
3. **Code Example Compilation Testing:** Validate that all TypeScript code examples can be parsed and type-checked successfully
4. **Accessibility Pattern Verification:** Test that all documented accessibility patterns meet WCAG 2.1 standards
5. **Performance Claim Validation:** Verify that documented performance optimization techniques are technically sound

### Implementation-Specific Testing Requirements
- **Intersection Observer Pattern Testing:** Validate documented API usage patterns are correct and efficient
- **GPU Acceleration Technique Verification:** Ensure documented `will-change` and transform patterns are optimal
- **Mobile Battery Optimization Validation:** Verify documented mobile performance patterns are battery-efficient
- **Theme Integration Testing:** Confirm dark mode patterns maintain performance parity with light mode
