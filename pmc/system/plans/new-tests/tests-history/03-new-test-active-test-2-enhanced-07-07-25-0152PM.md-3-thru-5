# PREREQUISITES: You are in aplio-modern-1/ directory
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: All Phase 1 & 2 artifacts confirmed and ready for visual testing
# FAILURE HANDLING: If any artifacts missing, complete Phase 1 & 2 before proceeding

# Verify test environment is running
curl -s http://localhost:3333/status > /dev/null && echo "✓ Test server running" || echo "✗ Test server not running - restart required"
curl -s http://localhost:3334 > /dev/null && echo "✓ Dashboard running" || echo "✗ Dashboard not running - restart required"

# Verify component discovery results
if [ -f "../pmc/system/plans/task-approach/current-test-discovery.md" ]; then
  echo "✓ Component discovery results available"
else
  echo "✗ Component discovery results missing - Phase 1 incomplete"
fi

# Verify enhanced scaffolds exist
SCAFFOLD_COUNT=$(find test/scaffolds/T-3.2.3 -name "*-enhanced.html" 2>/dev/null | wc -l)
if [ "$SCAFFOLD_COUNT" -eq 4 ]; then
  echo "✓ All 4 enhanced scaffolds available"
else
  echo "✗ Enhanced scaffolds missing (found: $SCAFFOLD_COUNT, expected: 4) - Phase 1 incomplete"
fi

# Verify unit tests exist and coverage
if [ -f "test/unit-tests/task-3-2/T-3.2.3/Accordion.test.tsx" ]; then
  echo "✓ Unit test file exists"
  npm test -- --testPathPattern=task-3-2/T-3.2.3 --coverage --silent || echo "✗ Unit tests not passing - Phase 2 incomplete"
else
  echo "✗ Unit test file missing - Phase 2 incomplete"
fi

echo "Phase 1 & 2 verification complete - ready for Phase 3-5"
```

## Phase 3: Visual Testing

### Prerequisites (builds on Phase 2)
- Component discovery and classification complete from Phase 1
- Unit testing complete from Phase 2
- Enhanced scaffolds generated for all T-3.2.3 components
- Test server running on port 3333
- Scaffolds contain real React content with styling

### Actions

#### Step 3.1: Execute Enhanced Visual Testing for T-3.2.3
```bash
# PURPOSE: Capture pixel-perfect screenshots of all T-3.2.3 components using Playwright
# WHEN: Run this after unit testing and scaffold generation to create visual testing artifacts
# DOCUMENTATION: You MUST read all of pmc/system/plans/task-approach/current-test-discovery.md because all testable elements have been documented there.
# PREREQUISITES: Enhanced scaffolds exist, test server running, Playwright installed
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: High-quality PNG screenshots captured for all 4 T-3.2.3 components
# FAILURE HANDLING: If visual testing fails, restart test server and check scaffold accessibility

# Enhanced Visual Testing for T-3.2.3 Container Components
COMPONENTS=("Accordion" "AccordionFocusManager" "AccordionMultipleVariant" "AccordionControlled")

for component in "${COMPONENTS[@]}"; do
  echo "Capturing screenshot for ${component}..."
  
  # Capture screenshot with proper viewport and styling
  npx playwright-cli screenshot \
    --viewport-size=1200x800 \
    --full-page \
    --type=png \
    "http://localhost:3333/test/scaffolds/T-3.2.3/${component}-enhanced.html" \
    "test/screenshots/T-3.2.3/${component}-enhanced.png" || echo "RETRY: Screenshot failed for ${component}"
  
  if [ -f "test/screenshots/T-3.2.3/${component}-enhanced.png" ]; then
    echo "✓ ${component} screenshot captured successfully"
  else
    echo "✗ ${component} screenshot capture failed"
  fi
done

echo "Visual testing complete for T-3.2.3"
```

#### Step 3.2: Validate Screenshot Generation
```bash
# PURPOSE: Verify all expected T-3.2.3 component screenshots were successfully captured
# WHEN: Run this after visual testing to confirm all artifacts are ready for LLM Vision analysis
# PREREQUISITES: Visual testing completed, test/screenshots/T-3.2.3/ directory exists
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: 4 PNG screenshot files confirmed for T-3.2.3 components
# FAILURE HANDLING: If screenshots missing, re-run visual testing for missing components

node -e "
const fs = require('fs');
const screenshotDir = 'test/screenshots/T-3.2.3';
const expectedComponents = ['Accordion', 'AccordionFocusManager', 'AccordionMultipleVariant', 'AccordionControlled'];

if (!fs.existsSync(screenshotDir)) {
  throw new Error('Screenshot directory not found: ' + screenshotDir);
}

const screenshots = fs.readdirSync(screenshotDir).filter(f => f.endsWith('.png'));
console.log('Generated screenshots:', screenshots.length);

let allValid = true;
expectedComponents.forEach(component => {
  const fileName = component + '-enhanced.png';
  if (screenshots.includes(fileName)) {
    console.log('✓', component, 'screenshot captured');
  } else {
    console.log('✗', component, 'screenshot missing');
    allValid = false;
  }
});

if (!allValid) {
  throw new Error('Some T-3.2.3 component screenshots are missing');
}
console.log('All T-3.2.3 component screenshots validated');
"
```

#### Step 3.3: Validate Component Boundaries in Screenshots
```bash
# PURPOSE: Verify visual boundaries are properly displayed in enhanced scaffolds
# WHEN: Run this after screenshot validation to ensure component classification is visually clear
# PREREQUISITES: Enhanced scaffolds exist with component boundary styling
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: Server components show blue boundaries, client components show green boundaries
# FAILURE HANDLING: If boundaries missing, regenerate scaffolds with proper boundary injection

# Verify server component boundaries (blue)
grep -q "Server Component: Accordion" "test/scaffolds/T-3.2.3/Accordion-enhanced.html" && echo "✓ Accordion has server boundary (blue)" || echo "✗ Accordion missing server boundary"
grep -q "Server Component: AccordionMultipleVariant" "test/scaffolds/T-3.2.3/AccordionMultipleVariant-enhanced.html" && echo "✓ AccordionMultipleVariant has server boundary (blue)" || echo "✗ AccordionMultipleVariant missing server boundary"
grep -q "Server Component: AccordionControlled" "test/scaffolds/T-3.2.3/AccordionControlled-enhanced.html" && echo "✓ AccordionControlled has server boundary (blue)" || echo "✗ AccordionControlled missing server boundary"

# Verify client component boundaries (green)
grep -q "Client Component: AccordionFocusManager" "test/scaffolds/T-3.2.3/AccordionFocusManager-enhanced.html" && echo "✓ AccordionFocusManager has client boundary (green)" || echo "✗ AccordionFocusManager missing client boundary"
```

### Validation
- [ ] All 4 T-3.2.3 component screenshots captured
- [ ] Screenshots are high-quality PNG files
- [ ] Server components display blue visual boundaries
- [ ] Client components display green visual boundaries
- [ ] Tailwind CSS styling visible in screenshots

### Deliverables

- Visual regression testing artifacts
- Component boundary validation results

## Phase 4: Integration Testing

### Prerequisites (builds on Phase 3)
- Component discovery and classification complete from Phase 1
- Unit testing complete from Phase 2
- All 4 T-3.2.3 component screenshots captured
- Testing environment established

### Actions

#### Step 4.1: Execute T-3.2.3 Container Integration Tests
```bash
# PURPOSE: Test T-3.2.3 container integration with existing T-3.2.2 AccordionItem components
# WHEN: Run this after visual testing to validate container-item coordination
# PREREQUISITES: T-3.2.2 AccordionItem components available, T-3.2.3 container implemented
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: Container properly coordinates with individual items without interfering
# FAILURE HANDLING: If integration fails, check component compatibility and state management

Context: This is an accordion container that orchestrates multiple AccordionItem components with variant support, state management, and focus coordination.

Please analyze this screenshot and provide:

1. **Component Classification**: 
   - Is this a Server Component (blue boundary) or Client Component (green boundary)?
   - Does the visual boundary color match the expected component type?

2. **Content Quality Assessment**:
   - Does this show real React content (not placeholder/mock HTML)?
   - Are Tailwind CSS classes properly applied?
   - Is the content meaningful and related to accordion functionality?

3. **Container-Specific Validation**:
   - If this is an accordion container, does it show multiple accordion items?
   - Are the accordion items properly structured with headers and content?
   - Is the variant behavior (single/multiple-open) visually apparent?

4. **Visual Quality**:
   - Are borders, shadows, and styling properly rendered?
   - Is the component boundary clearly visible?
   - Does the overall design look professional and consistent?

5. **Confidence Score**: Provide a percentage (0-100%) confidence in your analysis.
