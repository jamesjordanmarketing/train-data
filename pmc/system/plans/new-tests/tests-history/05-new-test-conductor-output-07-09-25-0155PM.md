# AI Testing Agent Conductor Prompt - T-3.2.4 Optimized

## Overview

You are an AI Testing Agent responsible for conducting comprehensive automated testing for Next.js application components. Your primary goal is to validate that components meet both functional and visual requirements while autonomously identifying and fixing issues through iterative cycles.

**IMPORTANT CONTEXT**: This conductor prompt is optimized for T-3.2.4 Accordion Testing and Optimization, which has been **COMPLETED** with 90% code coverage achieved. This serves as a template for future accordion-related testing tasks.

Your primary mission is to orchestrate the testing process for the current active task defined within the Project Memory Core (PMC) system. All test system commands are best run from the aplio-modern-1 directory using node bin/[command]. Follow these steps precisely **each time you are invoked with this prompt**:

## Step 1: Review Testing Directions Document

**Primary Test Plan**: Load and thoroughly analyze the optimized test plan directions found in `pmc\core\active-task-unit-tests-2-enhanced.md`

**Complementary Test Plans** (For comprehensive testing cycles):
- `pmc\core\active-task-unit-tests-2-enhanced-phases-1-2.md` - Environment setup, component discovery, and unit testing
- `pmc\core\active-task-unit-tests-2-enhanced-phases-3-5.md` - Visual testing, integration testing, and final validation

**Key Actions**:
- Identify the specific task ID and testing requirements
- Note required test types (unit, component, visual) and acceptance criteria
- Understand the phased approach (if applicable) and which phases are required for your task

## Step 2: Analyze Current Task Context

**Primary Context Sources**:
- Review the active task details from `pmc\core\active-task.md`
- Understand component specifications, interactivity requirements, and boundaries
- Identify task completion status and any existing test infrastructure

**For T-3.2.4 Specific Context**:
- Task Status: **COMPLETED** with 90% code coverage
- Components: Accordion.tsx, AccordionFocusManager.tsx, AccordionProvider.tsx
- Test Infrastructure: Enhanced Jest setup (v1.3.0) with focus management resolution
- Coverage Achievement: 120+ comprehensive test cases implemented

## Step 3: Review Implementation Notes from Previous Agent

**Implementation Context**: Review the implementation notes directly from `system\plans\new-tests\02-new-test-carry-context-07-09-25-0155PM.md`

**Critical Information to Extract**:
- Task completion status and achievements
- Any additional or new recommendations from the implementing agent
- Test infrastructure enhancements (e.g., Jest setup modifications)
- Coverage metrics and validation results
- Production readiness status

**For T-3.2.4 Specific Notes**:
- **COMPLETED STATUS**: All acceptance criteria met, 90% coverage achieved
- **Critical Resolution**: Jest focus management crisis resolved with enhanced setup
- **Test Suite**: 120+ comprehensive test cases across all components
- **Production Ready**: Components validated for deployment

## Step 4: Archive and Reset Test Files

**Purpose**: Create clean slate for new testing cycle while preserving history

**Command**:
```bash
node system/management/test-approach-and-discovery.js
```

**Expected Outcome**:
- Archive current-test-approach.md and current-test-discovery.md to approach-history directory
- Create blank versions for new test cycle
- Preserve existing test infrastructure and results

**For T-3.2.4**: This step may not be necessary as the task is complete, but provides template for future testing cycles.

## Step 5: Generate Testing Approach

**Primary Instructions**: Read the file `pmc\system\coding-prompts\03-test-approach-prompt-v3-enhanced.md` and execute the instructions immediately.

**Process**:
1. Read `pmc\core\active-task-unit-tests-2-enhanced.md`
2. Generate testing approach in `pmc\system\plans\task-approach\current-test-approach.md`
3. Run `node bin\aplio-agent-cli.js test-approach` from pmc to populate the approach into enhanced test plan
4. **WAIT** for human operator instructions before proceeding to Step 6

**For T-3.2.4**: The testing approach has been completed and documented. Use existing approach as reference for similar accordion testing tasks.

## Step 6: Execute Active Test Plan

**Primary Focus**: Turn your full attention to the file `pmc\core\active-task-unit-tests-2-enhanced.md`

**Execution Guidelines**:
- This file contains detailed instructions, elements, and procedures for the current coding task
- Execute testing described in the enhanced test plan diligently
- Follow all specified commands, tests, and instructions until testing is completed
- **Do NOT deviate** from the instructions provided in the enhanced test plan

**Understanding Complementary Test Plans**:
- If your task requires phased testing, reference the phases-1-2 and phases-3-5 files
- These files work together as a complete testing suite
- Phases 1-2: Environment setup, discovery, and unit testing
- Phases 3-5: Visual testing, integration testing, and final validation

**For T-3.2.4 Specific Execution**:
- **TASK COMPLETE**: All testing has been successfully completed
- **Available Resources**: Comprehensive test suite, coverage reports, and validation results
- **Next Steps**: Use as template for future accordion testing or proceed to next task (T-3.3.0)

## Completion Reporting

After completing all tests, notify the human operator with:

1. **Overall Testing Status**: 
   - Pass/fail summary for all test phases
   - Coverage metrics achieved
   - Critical issues resolved

2. **Generated Reports**:
   - Links to generated visual test reports
   - Links to working component scaffolds
   - Coverage reports and metrics

3. **Test Results Summary**:
   - Summary of visual regression results
   - LLM Visual Testing results (if applicable)
   - Performance validation outcomes

4. **Recommendations**:
   - Any manual review needed
   - Production readiness assessment
   - Next steps for deployment or further testing

## T-3.2.4 Specific Completion Status

**TASK COMPLETED**: T-3.2.4 Accordion Testing and Optimization has been successfully completed with the following achievements:

✅ **90% Code Coverage**: Achieved across all components
✅ **120+ Test Cases**: Comprehensive unit testing implemented
✅ **Jest Infrastructure**: Enhanced setup (v1.3.0) with focus management resolution
✅ **Accessibility Compliance**: WCAG 2.1 AA standards validated
✅ **Performance Optimization**: Memoization and lazy loading implemented
✅ **Production Ready**: All components validated for deployment

**Available Resources**:
- Complete test suite at `aplio-modern-1/test/unit-tests/task-3-2/T-3.2.4/`
- Enhanced Jest setup at `aplio-modern-1/jest.setup.T-3.2.4.js`
- Coverage reports at `aplio-modern-1/coverage-final.json`
- Comprehensive documentation and validation results

**Next Steps**: Task complete - proceed to T-3.3.0 (Navigation Component Implementation) or use T-3.2.4 as template for future accordion testing tasks.
