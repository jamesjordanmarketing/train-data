# Development Context & Operational Priorities
**Date:** 06/23/2025, 10:10 PM
**Project:** Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1) & Project Memory Core (PMC)
**Context Version:** 3.0.0
**Testing Phase:** T-2.3.1 Animation Pattern Documentation Validation

## Introduction

This context document addresses two integrated projects that operate in tandem:

1. **Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1)**: A comprehensive modernization project converting the legacy Aplio Design System to leverage Next.js 14's App Router architecture and TypeScript. The project focuses on the Home-4 template implementation while preserving visual fidelity and enhancing developer experience.

2. **Project Memory Core (PMC)**: A structured task management and context retention system that manages the development of the Aplio project. PMC provides methodical task tracking, context preservation, and implementation guidance through its command-line interface and document-based workflow.

These projects are deliberately interconnected - PMC requires a real-world development project to refine its capabilities, while Aplio benefits from PMC's structured approach to development. Depending on current priorities, work may focus on either advancing the Aplio Design System implementation or enhancing the PMC tooling itself.

## Current Focus

### T-2.3.1 Active Testing Focus

**Task Summary**: T-2.3.1 successfully implemented comprehensive animation pattern documentation for the Next.js 14 design system, creating 5 detailed documentation files (90KB total) in `aplio-modern-1/design-system/docs/animations/entry-exit/`. The task analyzed legacy animation patterns from `aplio-legacy/data/animation.js` and component implementations to produce implementation-ready specifications with precise timing values (500ms entry, 300ms exit, 200ms stagger intervals), comprehensive dark mode coverage, and migration guidelines following T-2.2.6's successful approach.

**What is being tested**: Five comprehensive animation documentation files created for entry/exit animation patterns:
1. `entry-animations.md` (11.9KB) - Entry animation patterns and timing specifications
2. `exit-animations.md` (16.6KB) - Exit animation patterns and page transitions  
3. `fade-patterns.md` (18.9KB) - Comprehensive fade patterns and sequencing
4. `animation-sequencing.md` (21KB) - Complex sequencing and staggering patterns
5. `implementation-guide.md` (22.3KB) - Complete implementation guide and checklist

**Why it is being tested**: These documentation files provide implementation-ready specifications for AI agents to build sophisticated animations while maintaining the legacy system's polished interactions. The documentation must be validated for accuracy, completeness, and implementation-readiness before being used by other development agents.

**Current state of implementation**: All three phases (PREP, IMP, VAL) completed successfully. All 5 documentation files created with comprehensive coverage including dark mode specifications, legacy code reference accuracy validated, and implementation-ready specifications confirmed.

**Critical context for testing continuation**: The documentation follows T-2.2.6's successful pattern which achieved 95/100 implementation-readiness score. All legacy references have been validated for accuracy, timing standards are consistent across all files, and comprehensive dark mode coverage is present in all documentation.

### Aplio Design System Modernization Project

#### Project Overview
This project aims to transform the existing JavaScript-based Aplio theme into a modern TypeScript-powered Next.js 14 platform. The project specifically focuses on migrating the Home 4 template (https://js-aplio-6.vercel.app/home-4) as the flagship demonstration while preserving Aplio's premium design aesthetics from the existing design system in `/aplio-legacy/`.

#### Key Documents
1. Seed Story: `pmc/product/00-aplio-mod-1-seed-story.md`
2. Project Overview: `pmc/product/00-aplio-mod-1-seed-narrative.md`
3. Raw Data: `pmc/product/_seeds/00-narrative-raw_data-ts-14-v3.md`

#### Project Objectives

##### Primary Goals
1. Migrate Home 4 template to Next.js 14 App Router architecture
2. Preserve exact design elements from `/aplio-legacy/`
3. Implement TypeScript with full type safety
4. Maintain premium design quality and animations

##### Technical Requirements
1. Next.js 14 App Router implementation

### Project Memory Core (PMC) System

#### Core Functionality
Everything in this section is supporting information only. Do NOT select the current task focus from this section.
PMC is a structured modern software development task management and context retention system built around the the main active task file as its central operational component. PMC is product agnostic. In this instance we are using it to code the Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1) system described above. The system provides:

1. **Context Locality**: Instructions and context are kept directly alongside their relevant tasks
2. **Structured Checkpoints**: Regular token-based checks prevent context drift
3. **Directive Approach**: Clear commands and instructions with explicit timing requirements
4. **Task-Centric Documentation**: Single source of truth for task implementation

#### Commands

The driver for most PMC commands are in:
`pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js`

The code for most PMC commands are contained within:
- The original context manager script: `pmc/system/management/context-manager.js`
- The second context manager script: `pmc/system/management/context-manager-v2.js` (created when the original got too large)
- The third context manager script: `pmc/system/management/context-manager-v3.js` (created when the second got too large)

Here are some important PMC commands:

##### Add Structured Task Approaches
```bash
node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js task-approach
```

##### Add Structured Test Approaches
```bash
node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js test-approach

#### Project Structure
```
project-root/aplio-legacy/ (legacy system)
project-root/aplio-modern-1/ (new system)
project-root/pmc/ (PMC system)

```

## Critical Testing Context

**Legacy Reference Validation Requirements**: All animation timing specifications must match legacy implementations exactly:
- `fadeUpAnimation` duration 0.5s matches legacy animation.js line specifications
- Delay patterns (0.2s, 0.4s, 0.6s) validated against legacy sequences  
- `viewport: { once: true }` patterns correctly documented from FadeUpAnimation.jsx
- Staggering formula `i * 0.2` accurately captured from FadeUpOneByOneAnimation component

**Implementation Readiness Constraints**: Documentation must provide sufficient detail for AI agents to implement without ambiguity. Each animation pattern requires complete specifications including timing values, easing functions, Framer Motion integration examples, and React component integration patterns.

**T-2.2.6 Success Pattern Adherence**: The documentation structure and quality standards must match T-2.2.6's approach that achieved 95/100 score. This includes consistent markdown structure, comprehensive coverage, and implementation-ready specifications.

## Testing Focus Areas

â€¢ **Legacy Code Accuracy Validation**: Verify all references to `aplio-legacy/data/animation.js` and component files cite correct line numbers and code patterns
â€¢ **Timing Standards Consistency**: Confirm 500ms entry, 300ms exit, and 200ms stagger intervals are consistently documented across all 5 files
â€¢ **Dark Mode Coverage Completeness**: Validate comprehensive dark mode specifications are present in all documentation files
â€¢ **Implementation Readiness Assessment**: Test that documentation provides sufficient detail for autonomous AI implementation
â€¢ **Cross-File Consistency**: Ensure animation patterns are consistently documented across all 5 files without conflicts
â€¢ **Migration Guide Accuracy**: Validate migration instructions accurately reflect differences between legacy and modern implementations

## Modified Testing Approaches

**Documentation-Focused Testing Strategy**: Unlike component testing, T-2.3.1 requires validation of documentation quality, accuracy, and implementation-readiness rather than functional component testing. Testing must focus on content validation, reference accuracy, and specification completeness.

**Legacy Reference Validation Protocol**: Testing must include systematic verification of all legacy code references against actual legacy files to ensure accuracy of timing values, function names, and implementation patterns.

**AI Implementation Readiness Testing**: Documentation must be tested for sufficient detail to enable autonomous AI implementation without requiring additional clarification or research.
