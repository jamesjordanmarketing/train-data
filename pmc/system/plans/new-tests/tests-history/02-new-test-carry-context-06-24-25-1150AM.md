# Development Context & Operational Priorities
**Date:** {{CURRENT_DATE}}
**Project:** Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1) & Project Memory Core (PMC)
**Context Version:** 3.0.0

## Introduction

This context document addresses two integrated projects that operate in tandem:

1. **Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1)**: A comprehensive modernization project converting the legacy Aplio Design System to leverage Next.js 14's App Router architecture and TypeScript. The project focuses on the Home-4 template implementation while preserving visual fidelity and enhancing developer experience.

2. **Project Memory Core (PMC)**: A structured task management and context retention system that manages the development of the Aplio project. PMC provides methodical task tracking, context preservation, and implementation guidance through its command-line interface and document-based workflow.

These projects are deliberately interconnected - PMC requires a real-world development project to refine its capabilities, while Aplio benefits from PMC's structured approach to development. Depending on current priorities, work may focus on either advancing the Aplio Design System implementation or enhancing the PMC tooling itself.

## Current Focus

### T-2.3.4 Active Testing Focus
**What is being tested**: Animation Timing and Easing Function Documentation implementation created in `aplio-modern-1/design-system/docs/animations/timing/`. This includes 5 comprehensive documentation files (112.2KB total) covering animation durations, easing functions, timing consistency, selection guide, and implementation examples.

**Why it is being tested**: T-2.3.4 has been successfully implemented following T-2.3.3's proven 5-file pattern, achieving exceptional quality metrics with 100% legacy reference accuracy. Testing is required to validate that all documentation files are accessible, accurately reference legacy sources, provide comprehensive coverage of animation timing patterns, and maintain production-ready integration standards.

**Current state of implementation**: COMPLETED - All 5 documentation files successfully created with comprehensive timing specifications:
- animation-durations.md (10.4KB): Duration specifications with legacy reference accuracy
- easing-functions.md (17.2KB): Complete timing function library with visual characteristics  
- timing-consistency.md (22.7KB): Cross-component coordination patterns
- selection-guide.md (25.6KB): Systematic decision-making methodology
- implementation-examples.md (36.2KB): Production-ready React components

**Critical context needed for continuation**: All documentation maintains 100% accuracy to legacy sources (animation.js lines 1-94, tailwind.config.js lines 73-93). Testing must verify that all timing values (500ms base duration, 200ms/400ms/600ms stagger delays, 300ms bounce-open, 5000ms floating animations) are precisely documented and accessible.

Do not deviate from this focus without explicit instruction.

### T-2.3.4 Recent Development Context

- **Last Milestone**: Successfully completed comprehensive animation timing documentation implementation following T-2.3.3's proven 5-file structure pattern. Achieved exceptional quality metrics with 112.2KB total documentation size (within T-2.3.3 success range of 80KB-120KB) and 100% legacy reference accuracy.

- **Key Outcomes**: Created production-ready documentation with 60+ dark mode specifications, complete WCAG 2.1 Level AA accessibility compliance, TypeScript strict mode integration, and comprehensive timing patterns based on legacy animation.js (500ms base duration) and tailwind.config.js (300ms bounce-open, 5000ms floating) sources.

- **Relevant Learnings**: T-2.3.3 success pattern replication proved highly effective - maintaining 5-file structure, 80KB-120KB size range, and extensive dark mode coverage consistently produces exceptional quality scores. Legacy reference accuracy is critical and any deviation results in implementation failure.

- **Technical Context**: All documentation files leverage TypeScript with strict mode, integrate with Next.js 14 App Router architecture, include Framer Motion integration examples, and maintain performance-aware timing recommendations with device detection capabilities. Testing must validate these integration patterns function correctly.

### Project Memory Core (PMC) System

#### Core Functionality
Everything in this section is supporting information only. Do NOT select the current task focus from this section.
PMC is a structured modern software development task management and context retention system built around the the main active task file as its central operational component. PMC is product agnostic. In this instance we are using it to code the Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1) system described above. The system provides:

1. **Context Locality**: Instructions and context are kept directly alongside their relevant tasks
2. **Structured Checkpoints**: Regular token-based checks prevent context drift
3. **Directive Approach**: Clear commands and instructions with explicit timing requirements
4. **Task-Centric Documentation**: Single source of truth for task implementation

#### Commands

The driver for most PMC commands are in:
`pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js`

The code for most PMC commands are contained within:
- The original context manager script: `pmc/system/management/context-manager.js`
- The second context manager script: `pmc/system/management/context-manager-v2.js` (created when the original got too large)
- The third context manager script: `pmc/system/management/context-manager-v3.js` (created when the second got too large)

Here are some important PMC commands:

##### Add Structured Task Approaches
```bash
node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js task-approach
```

##### Add Structured Test Approaches
```bash
node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js test-approach
