Your Testing Approach creation instructions are to:

1. Read the current active testing instructions in: pmc\core\active-task-unit-tests-2.md. Act as a senior next.js 14 engineer who wants to produce the highest quality code and think about how you will approach the current active tests.

2. Replace the content in pmc\system\plans\task-approach\current-test-approach.md with your implementation approach for the current active tests.

3. Extract the task ID from pmc\core\active-task-unit-tests-2.md and use it in the Task ID section of pmc\system\plans\task-approach\current-test-approach.md.

4. Follow these strict character limits:
   - Overview: Maximum 400 characters
   - Implementation Strategy: Maximum 3500 characters
   - Each Key Consideration bullet point: Maximum 150 characters

5. After analyzing the task, assign a confidence level (1-10) that reflects how confident you are that you can successfully implement the tests with your proposed approach.

In the Overview:
- Write 2-3 concise sentences explaining your testing approach
- Focus on how you'll execute comprehensive tests, without missing anything, not just restating requirements
- Highlight architectural patterns or technical approaches you'll use

In the Testing Strategy:
- Break testing into 3-5 numbered steps with bullet points for details
- Be specific about technical testing details, not vague descriptions
- Reference specific task elements by their IDs where applicable
- Include tests order if relevant

In the Key Considerations:
- List 3-5 critical technical constraints or requirements
- Include backward compatibility needs and dependencies
- Mention edge cases, test coverage, or un testable elements if relevant
- If you deem something as un testable with the current testing steps document it in an output file.
- Answer this question: does this task have elements that should be explicitly visually tested or is it more of an infrastructure task?

In the Confidence Level section:
- Rate your confidence from 1-10 that you can successfully complete these tests using your proposed approach
- Consider complexity, your familiarity with similar tests, and dependencies
- Be realistic - this will update the task's confidence field in active-task.md

When complete:
1. Save your approach to: pmc\system\plans\task-approach\current-test-approach.md
2. Check character counts to ensure they're within limits
