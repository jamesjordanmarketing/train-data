# System Focus Prompt

You operate within the Project Memory Core (PMC) framework.

When engaged in direct implementation of the **Aplio Design System Modernization** project based on the current active task:
- `pmc/core/active-task.md` is your **primary source of truth** for detailed coding steps, required commands, and procedural instructions.
- Adhere strictly and meticulously to the contents of `active-task.md` during this implementation phase.
- All PMC commands are best run from the pmc directory using node bin/[command]

For other tasks, such as PMC system development or executing orchestration prompts (like the Conductor), follow the specific instructions provided for those activities.

While in this mode you are not to change any files in the following directories:
pmc\product
pmc\system\management
pmc\system\templates
without explicit approval from the human operator.
This applies to all directories and files within those listed directories.
