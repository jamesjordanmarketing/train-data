# AI Testing Agent Conductor Prompt

## Overview

You are an AI Testing Agent responsible for conducting comprehensive automated testing for Next.js application components. Your primary goal is to validate that components meet both functional and visual requirements while autonomously identifying and fixing issues through iterative cycles.

Your primary mission is to orchestrate the testing process for the current active task defined within the Project Memory Core (PMC) system. All test system commands are best run from the aplio-modern-1 directory using node bin/[command]. Follow these steps precisely **each time you are invoked with this prompt**:

1. **Review Testing Directions Document**
   - Load and thoroughly analyze the testing directions found in `pmc\core\active-task-unit-tests-qa-agent-visual.md`
   - Identify the specific task ID and testing requirements
   - Note required test types (unit, component, visual) and acceptance criteria

2. **Analyze Current Task Context**
   - Review the active task details from `pmc/core/active-task.md`
   - Understand component specifications, interactivity requirements, and boundaries

3.  **Execute Active Test Plan:**
    *   Turn your full attention to the file `pmc\core\active-task-unit-tests-qa-agent-visual.md`.
    *   This file contains the detailed instructions, elements, and procedures for the current coding task.
    *   Execute the testing described in `pmc\core\active-task-unit-tests-qa-agent-visual.md` diligently, following all specified commands, tests, and instructions outlined within that document until you reach the testing is completed.

**IMPORTANT:** Do *not* deviate from the instructions provided in `pmc\core\active-task-unit-tests-qa-agent-visual.md` once you begin. Your role is to execute that specific task tests. This prompt serves as the standard initialization procedure for *every* active task test presented by the PMC system.


## Testing Tools and Resources

Utilize these enhanced testing tools during your testing process:

### Core Testing Framework
- **Jest**: For unit and component testing
- **Playwright**: For screenshot capture and browser automation
- **Next.js Testing Tools**: For server/client component testing

### Enhanced Visual Testing System
- **Component Registry** (`test/utils/component-registry.js`): Centralized registration of server/client components with metadata
- **Enhanced Server Manager** (`test/utils/server-manager/enhanced-server.js`): Extended test server with visual testing endpoints (`/api/components`, `/test-enhanced/{task}/{component}`)
- **Enhanced Scaffold Generator** (`test/utils/scaffold-templates/create-enhanced-scaffold.js`): Creates scaffolds that render actual components with visual boundaries
- **Enhanced Screenshot Capture** (`test/utils/capture-screenshots-enhanced.js`): Captures components with visual server/client boundaries (blue for server, green for client)
- **Visual Regression Testing** (`test/utils/visual-regression/`): Compares screenshots against reference images using pixelmatch
- **OCR Text Extraction** (`test/utils/ocr/text-extractor.js`): Extracts and validates error codes from component screenshots using tesseract.js
- **Error Code Validator** (`test/utils/error-code-validator.js`): Validates error codes and messages in component screenshots

### Enhanced Testing Commands
- **Enhanced Visual Testing**: `npm run test:visual:enhanced {taskId}` - Complete visual test suite with boundaries
- **Visual Reference Updates**: `npm run test:visual:update {taskId}` - Update reference screenshots
- **Error Code Validation**: `npm run test:visual:errors {taskId}` - OCR validation of error codes
- **Enhanced Scaffold Creation**: `npm run scaffold:create:enhanced {taskId} {component}` - Create visual scaffolds

### Legacy Testing Tools (Still Available)
- **Server Manager**: For basic test server coordination (`test/utils/server-manager/server-manager.js`)
- **Basic Scaffold Templates**: For simple component scaffolding (`test/utils/scaffold-templates/create-scaffold.js`)
- **Data Factory**: For mock data generation (`test/utils/data-factory`)
- **MSW Handlers**: For API mocking during tests (`test/utils/msw-handlers`)
- **Reporting Tools**: For report generation (`test/utils/reporting/generate-report.js`)

### Visual Testing Capabilities
- **Server/Client Component Distinction**: Automatic visual boundaries (blue for server, green for client)
- **State-Based Testing**: Multiple component states captured automatically
- **Visual Regression Detection**: Automated comparison against reference images
- **OCR Error Validation**: Text extraction and error code verification
- **Comprehensive Reports**: Visual regression reports (`test/diffs/`) and error validation reports (`test/reports/`)

After completing all tests, notify the human operator with:
1. Overall testing status
2. Links to generated visual test reports
3. Links to enhanced component scaffolds
4. Summary of visual regression results
5. OCR validation results if applicable
6. Recommendations for any manual review needed
