(To be filled in by the coding agent)

## Task Development Work Pad

As you work on this task, you may use the dedicated work pad file at:
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\BRun\brun3a\pmc\core\task-work-pad-dev.md`

This work pad is your thinking space where you can:
- Work through complex implementation approaches
- Document decisions you're making and why
- Keep track of issues to revisit later
- Break down challenging problems into steps
- Test code snippets before final implementation
- Track progress across multiple components

Using this work pad is entirely optional but encouraged for complex tasks where external thinking would be beneficial. Nothing written there will be evaluated as final code - it's purely to assist your development process.

When using the work pad, start each new entry with a timestamp and brief context header to keep your thoughts organized.

## Components/Elements
{{ELEMENTS_SECTION}}

## Implementation Process Phases
### Preparation Phase    
   - PREP Phase guidance: These Preparation Steps highlight key research and analysis activities but aren't exhaustive. Your primary goal is to prepare for complete implementation of all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Enhance these steps as needed to ensure comprehensive preparation.
   - **DSAP REQUIREMENT**: Complete STEP 1 (Documentation Discovery) during this phase for all design-related tasks.

{{PREPARATION_PHASE}}

When the Preparation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage {{TASK_ID}} "PREP" "complete"
from the directory pmc

### Implementation Phase
   - IMP Phase guidance: These Implementation Steps outline core coding activities but aren't exhaustive. Your primary responsibility is to implement code that fulfills all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Extend beyond these steps when necessary to create a complete solution.
   - **DSAP REQUIREMENT**: Complete STEP 2 (Compliance Implementation) during this phase for all design-related tasks.

{{IMPLEMENTATION_PHASE}}

When the Implementation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage {{TASK_ID}} "IMP" "complete"
from the directory pmc

### Validation Phase
   - VAL Phase guidance: These Validation Steps suggest key testing activities but aren't comprehensive. Your ultimate goal is to verify that your implementation meets all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Add additional validation steps as needed to ensure complete quality assurance.
   - **DSAP REQUIREMENT**: Complete STEP 3 (Adherence Reporting) during this phase for all design-related tasks.

{{VALIDATION_PHASE}}

Validation Test Failure Strategy:
- Document all validation test failures with error messages and stack traces
- For each validation failure, implement fixes in the corresponding implementation file
- Rerun failed validation tests until they pass
- If a validation test cannot be fixed after 5 attempts, document the issue and proceed only if it doesn't affect critical functionality
- Log all validation test failures using the error command:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "<error description>" <severity 1-10>
  ```
  Example error logs:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Type error in button component" 7
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Critical performance issue" 9
  ```
When the Validation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage {{TASK_ID}} "VAL" "complete"
from the directory pmc

After completing the Validation Phase and submitting the VAL update-phase-stage "complete" command, you MUST stop and await instructions from the human operator.

## Testing Overview
Testing for this task is managed in a separate file to reduce cognitive load and ensure comprehensive test implementation.

## Recent Actions
Call this command when it will help record context that may be useful while coding this task.
```
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js log-action "<current task description>" <confidence 1-10>
```

## Notes
You may add implementation notes at any time by calling:
```
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-notes "<your implementation notes>"
```
Task initialized on {{TIMESTAMP}}
Implementation Status: Not Started

## Errors Encountered
If you encounter any errors, you MUST report them by calling:
```
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "<error description>" <severity 1-10>
```
If you have tried to fix an error 5 times and have not made any progress, you MUST call the error command, alert the human operator, and stop coding.

## Next Steps
1. Review task details and requirements (Priority: High)
2. **DSAP**: Complete Documentation Discovery if this is a design-related task (Priority: High)
3. Examine legacy code references (Priority: High)
4. Begin with first Preparation Phase Steps (PREP-1) steps and continue through all Validation Phase Steps (VAL-#) (Priority: High)

## Addendums

### Full Project Context
You can refresh your knowledge of the project and this task in context by reading these files:
- pmc/product/06-aplio-mod-1-tasks.md (for detailed task specifications)
- pmc/core/progress.md (for overall project progress)

### Prior Task and its Current Status
Prior Task: {{PRIOR_TASK_ID}}
Task Title: {{PRIOR_TASK_TITLE}}
Task Details: pmc\product\06-aplio-mod-1-tasks.md starts on line {{PRIOR_TASK_LINE}}
Is this task depended on by the current task? {{PRIOR_DEPENDENCY}}

### Next Task in Sequence
Next Task: {{NEXT_TASK_ID}}
Task Title: {{NEXT_TASK_TITLE}}
Task Details: pmc\product\06-aplio-mod-1-tasks.md starts on line {{NEXT_TASK_LINE}}
Is this task dependent on the current task? {{NEXT_DEPENDENCY}}

### New Dependencies
When implementing this task, if you identify a dependency requirement that meets BOTH criteria:
1. Not documented in the Task Information section
2. Not already implemented in the codebase

You MUST document this dependency by executing:
```
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js log-dependency "[task-id]" "[detailed dependency specification]"
```
Your dependency specification should include:
- What the dependency is (library, component, service, etc.)
- Why it's necessary for the current task
- How it impacts the implementation approach

After logging the dependency, paste the command output here and await human operator guidance before proceeding with implementation that relies on this dependency.

### Improvement Suggestions
During implementation, if you identify potential improvements that would enhance:
- Code quality or maintainability
- System flexibility or extensibility
- Feature capabilities or user experience
- Performance or security characteristics

You MUST document these insights by executing:
```
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js log-improvement "[task-id]" "[improvement specification]"
```
Your improvement specification should:
- Clearly articulate the proposed enhancement
- Provide a technical rationale for the suggestion
- Indicate the scope of impact (localized or system-wide)
- Note whether the improvement is critical or could be implemented later

After logging the improvement, paste the command output here, notify the human operator, and continue with your current task implementation.

IMPORTANT OPERATIONAL INSTRUCTIONS:

As you code this task if you ever become unsure that you are following the explicit path set for you in this file:
1. Read the active-task.md file to refresh context
2. Return back to what you were doing if it is contributing to the current task
3. If you are working on code that does not contribute to the current task, send a high priority alert to the human operator

As you code this task if you ever become unsure that your current approach to the task is valid you MUST read the Task Approach section of the current active-task.md:
1. If the approach is still valid, continue coding
2. If the approach has new context or details, add an **Addendum** to the Task Approach
3. If the approach has proven to be erroneous, add a **Major Approach Update** with detailed explanation

New bash shells ALWAYS open in pmc by default. Navigate accordingly when you start a new shell

We have been having some problems with bash terminals hanging on commands. To fix this append ` | cat` to all bash commands. The cat command reads all input and then terminates cleanly when the input stream closes. This ensures the command pipeline has a definitive end point.
