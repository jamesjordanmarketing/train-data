# Development Context & Operational Priorities
**Date:** {{CURRENT_DATE}}
**Project:** Bright Run LoRA Training Data Platform (bmo) & Project Memory Core (PMC)
**Context Version:** 3.0.0

## Introduction

This context document addresses two integrated projects that operate in tandem:

1. **Bright Run LoRA Training Data Platform**: Bright Run is a revolutionary LoRA fine-tuning training data platform that transforms unstructured business knowledge into high-quality training datasets through an intuitive 6-stage workflow. We are creating the first user-friendly solution that enables non-technical domain experts to convert their proprietary knowledge—transcripts, documents, and expertise—into thousands of semantically diverse training pairs suitable for LoRA model fine-tuning.

### What Problem Does This Product Solve?

Small business owners and domain experts possess invaluable proprietary knowledge—from marketing philosophies to operational processes—but face insurmountable barriers in transforming this knowledge into LoRA ready training data.

2. **Project Memory Core (PMC)**: A structured task management and context retention system that manages the development of the Aplio project. PMC provides methodical task tracking, context preservation, and implementation guidance through its command-line interface and document-based workflow.

These projects are deliberately interconnected - PMC requires a real-world development project to refine its capabilities, while Aplio benefits from PMC's structured approach to development. Depending on current priorities, work may focus on either advancing the Aplio Design System implementation or enhancing the PMC tooling itself.

## Current Focus

### Active Development Focus
[REQUIRED: Provide a detailed description of the current focus, including:
1. What is being worked on
2. Why it is being worked on
3. Current state of implementation
4. Any critical context needed for continuation]

Do not deviate from this focus without explicit instruction.
All other information in this document is reference material only.

### Current Active Action 
[CONDITIONAL: Include ONLY if there is an active action in progress. Must include:
1. Task ID and title
2. Current phase (Preparation/Implementation/Validation)
3. Active element being worked on
4. Last recorded action
Remove section if no active action.]

### Bugs & Challenges in the Current Task
[CONDITIONAL: Include ONLY if there are active bugs or challenges. For each issue include:
1. Issue description
2. Current status
3. Attempted solutions
4. Blocking factors
Remove section if no active issues.]

The Current Open Task section and Bugs & Challenges in the Current Task are a subset of the Active Development Focus section.

### Next Steps 
[REQUIRED: List the next actions in order of priority. Each item must include:
1. Action identifier (task ID, file path, etc.)
2. Brief description
3. Dependencies or blockers
4. Expected outcome
Maximum 5 items, minimum 2 items.]
The Next Steps section is a subset of the Active Development Focus section.

### Important Dependencies
[CONDITIONAL: Include ONLY if there are critical dependencies for the next steps. Each dependency must specify:
1. Dependency identifier
2. Current status
3. Impact on next steps
Remove section if no critical dependencies.]
The Important Dependencies section is a subset of the Active Development Focus section.

### Important Files
[REQUIRED: List all files that are essential for the current context. Format as:
1. File path from workspace root
2. Purpose/role in current task
3. Current state (if modified)
Only include files directly relevant to current work.]
The Important Files section is a subset of the Active Development Focus section.

### Important Scripts, Markdown Files, and Specifications
[CONDITIONAL: Include ONLY if there are specific scripts, documentation, or specs needed for the next steps. Format as:
1. File path from workspace root
2. Purpose/role in current context
3. Key sections to review
Remove section if not directly relevant.]
The Important Scripts, Markdown Files, and Specifications section is a subset of the Active Development Focus section.

### Recent Development Context
[CONDITIONAL: Include only if the current task builds upon or relates to recent development work. Remove section if starting fresh or switching context.]

- **Last Milestone**: Brief description of the most recently completed significant work
- **Key Outcomes**: Critical results or implementations that inform current work
- **Relevant Learnings**: Insights or patterns discovered that may apply to current focus
- **Technical Context**: Any technical state or configurations that carry forward

Example:
Last Milestone: Implemented status transition validation
Key Outcomes: Status checks now enforce valid state sequences
Relevant Learnings: State machine pattern proved effective for validation
Technical Context: Validation logic centralized in StatusManager class

#### Key Documents
1. Seed Story: `pmc/product/00-bmo-seed-story.md`
2. Project Overview: `pmc\product\01-bmo-overview.md`

1. **Context Locality**: Instructions and context are kept directly alongside their relevant tasks
2. **Structured Checkpoints**: Regular token-based checks prevent context drift
3. **Directive Approach**: Clear commands and instructions with explicit timing requirements
4. **Task-Centric Documentation**: Single source of truth for task implementation
