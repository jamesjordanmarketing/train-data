=========================Prompt=For=Building=Context=========================================
You are tasked with updating the context carryover file at:
{{CONTEXT_FILE_PATH}}

First, read the entire file to understand its current structure and content.

Then, update the "Current Focus" section with the following requirements:

1. **Active Development Focus**
   - Be explicit about the task
   - Include full paths where applicable

You are not going to execute the below. Your task is to update: {{CONTEXT_FILE_PATH}} with the details of what I am requesting below:

CONTENT

In the next carryover file: {{CONTEXT_FILE_PATH}} write a spec to get this done. Delete any sections which are not relevant.


2. **Section Updates**
   - REQUIRED sections must always be included and fully populated
   - CONDITIONAL sections should only be included if relevant criteria are met
   - You MUST remove any sections marked CONDITIONAL if you don't update those sections because they don't have relevant content
   - Maintain consistent formatting within each section

3. **Content Requirements**
   - All file paths must be from workspace root
   - All task IDs must include both ID and title
   - All descriptions must be specific and actionable
   - All next steps must include clear success criteria

4. **Context Preservation**
   - Include any critical context from the current session
   - Reference relevant documentation and specifications
   - Maintain links between related tasks and components
   - Document any decisions or changes that affect future work

After updating the sections, review the entire file to ensure:
1. All REQUIRED sections are present and complete
2. All CONDITIONAL sections are either properly populated or removed
3. All formatting is consistent
4. All references and links are valid
5. The context is sufficient for a new session to continue the work
