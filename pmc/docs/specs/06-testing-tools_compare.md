4. **Performance API** - Custom performance timing and metrics
5. **Axe** (partially) - Accessibility metrics and violations

## Recommendations for Complexity Management

1. **Primary Testing Tools to Standardize On:**
   - Jest + React Testing Library for component and unit testing
   - Playwright for E2E testing (consider consolidating E2E with just one tool instead of both Playwright and Cypress)
   - Axe for accessibility testing
   - Storybook for component development and documentation

2. **Tools with Significant Overlap:**
   - Playwright and Cypress - Consider standardizing on just one
   - Axe and Pa11y - Consider standardizing on just Axe
   - Chromatic and Percy - Consider standardizing on just one for visual testing
   - Jest and Vitest - Consider standardizing on Jest unless Vite-specific optimizations are critical

3. **Setup Complexity Reduction:**
   - Create standardized configuration templates for the primary tools
   - Document specific setup requirements for each tool in the project
   - Implement CI/CD pipelines that handle tool setup automatically

4. **Autonomous Testing Strategy:**
   - All identified tools can be used autonomously with proper setup
   - Create a standard autonomous testing workflow using the recommended primary tools
   - Implement a comprehensive CI pipeline that utilizes these tools automatically

By focusing on a standardized set of tools and reducing overlap, the project can maintain testing coverage while reducing complexity and increasing predictability.
