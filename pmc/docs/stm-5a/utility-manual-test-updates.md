read the current test plan for T-1.1.3 here:
pmc\product\_mapping\test-maps\07-bmo-test-mapping-output-E01.md

Now that you have actually executed the task I need you to customize the task test plan. Use the current plan pmc\product\_mapping\test-maps\07-bmo-test-mapping-output-E01.md as a structure and format. 

but rewrite it so that it tests exactly and ONLY what is left to be tested after your execution of this task. 

Append the new test plan here:
pmc\product\_mapping\test-maps\07-bmo-test-mapping-output-E01-custom_v1.md
