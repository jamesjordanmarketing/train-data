# T-1.2.2: Primary Category Selection Enhancement - Enhanced Testing Protocol

## Mission Statement
Execute complete testing cycle from environment setup through visual validation with LLM Vision analysis to ensure T-1.2.2 components (T-1.2.2:ELE-1, T-1.2.2:ELE-2) are properly implemented, styled, and functioning with component functionality.

## Fix/Test/Analyze Cycle Pattern
For any failed validation step in ANY phase:
1. **Log Issue**: Document failure details and error messages
2. **Attempt Fix**: Apply automated correction if possible  
3. **Re-run Test**: Execute the failed step again
4. **Evaluate Results**: Check if issue is resolved
5. **Update Artifacts**: Regenerate affected files (scaffolds, screenshots, reports)
6. **Repeat**: Continue until success or maximum iterations reached (default: 3 attempts)

## Test Approach
<!-- After reading the test requirements, describe your execution approach here -->
(To be filled in by the testing agent)

## Phase 0: Pre-Testing Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
- You are in the project root directory
- You have npm and Node.js installed
- Git bash or equivalent terminal access

### Actions

#### Step 0.1: Navigate to Application Directory
```bash
# PURPOSE: Navigate from pmc directory to aplio-modern-1 application directory where testing infrastructure exists
# WHEN: Execute this as the first step before any testing operations
# PREREQUISITES: You are currently in pmc directory (default shell location)
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: You will be in aplio-modern-1/ directory with access to test/ subdirectory
# FAILURE HANDLING: If directory doesn't exist, verify you're in the correct project structure

cd ..
cd aplio-modern-1
```

#### Step 0.2: Create Test Directory Structure
```bash
# PURPOSE: Create the complete directory structure required for T-1.2.2 testing artifacts
# WHEN: Run this before any testing phases to ensure all output directories exist
# PREREQUISITES: You are in aplio-modern-1/ directory
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: All required test directories exist for T-1.2.2 components
# FAILURE HANDLING: If mkdir fails, check permissions and available disk space

mkdir -p test/unit-tests/task-1-2.2/T-1.2.2
mkdir -p test/screenshots/T-1.2.2
mkdir -p test/scaffolds/T-1.2.2
mkdir -p test/references/T-1.2.2
mkdir -p test/diffs
mkdir -p test/reports
mkdir -p test/vision-results
```

#### Step 0.3: Start Testing Infrastructure
```bash
# PURPOSE: Start enhanced test server and dashboard for React SSR and visual testing
# WHEN: Run this after directory creation and keep running during all testing phases
# PREREQUISITES: npm packages installed, ports 3333 and 3334 available
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: Test server running on port 3333, dashboard on port 3334
# FAILURE HANDLING: If server fails to start, check port availability and npm dependencies

# Terminal 1: Start enhanced test server
npm run test:server:enhanced

# Wait for server startup, then verify
sleep 5
curl -s http://localhost:3333/status || echo "RETRY: npm run test:server:enhanced"

# Terminal 2: Start enhanced dashboard  
npm run test:dashboard:enhanced

# Wait for dashboard startup, then verify
sleep 3
curl -s http://localhost:3334 > /dev/null || echo "RETRY: npm run test:dashboard:enhanced"
```

#### Step 0.4: Verify System Dependencies
```bash
# PURPOSE: Ensure all required testing tools and dependencies are installed and functional
# WHEN: Run this after server startup to validate complete testing environment
# PREREQUISITES: npm is available, internet connection for package installation
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: Jest, Playwright, TypeScript, Enhanced scaffold system, and LLM Vision dependencies confirmed
# FAILURE HANDLING: Install missing packages as indicated by each check

npm list jest > /dev/null || npm install --save-dev jest
npx playwright --version > /dev/null || npx playwright install
npm list axios > /dev/null || npm install axios
node -e "require('ts-node')" || npm install --save-dev ts-node typescript
node -e "require('./test/utils/scaffold-templates/create-enhanced-scaffold.js')" || echo "CRITICAL: Enhanced scaffold system missing"
```

#### Step 1.2: Discover and Validate T-1.2.2 Components
```bash
# PURPOSE: Validate that all T-1.2.2 components can be imported and compiled
# WHEN: Run this after testable elements discovery to ensure components are ready for testing and scaffold generation
# DOCUMENTATION: You MUST read all of C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\pmc\system\plans\task-approach\current-test-discovery.md because all testable elements have been documented there.
# PREREQUISITES: Component importer system available, all T-1.2.2 components implemented
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: All 2 T-1.2.2 components successfully imported and validated
# FAILURE HANDLING: If component import fails, check file paths and TypeScript compilation errors

node -e "
const { ComponentImporter } = require('./test/utils/scaffold-templates/component-importer.js');
const importer = new ComponentImporter();
const T122Components = ['T-1.2.2:ELE-1', 'T-1.2.2:ELE-2'];

async function validateAllComponents() {
  for (const name of T122Components) {

      console.log('✓', name, 'imported successfully');
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('✗', name, 'failed:', error.message);
      throw error;
    }
  }
  console.log('All T-1.2.2 components validated');
}

validateAllComponents().catch(console.error);
"
```

#### Step 1.3: Generate Enhanced Scaffolds for All T-1.2.2 Components
```bash
# PURPOSE: Generate React SSR scaffolds with real rendering, Tailwind CSS, and visual boundaries for all T-1.2.2 components
# WHEN: Run this after component validation to create visual testing artifacts

# PREREQUISITES: Enhanced scaffold system available, components successfully imported
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: 2 enhanced scaffold HTML files created in test/scaffolds/T-1.2.2/ with real React content
# FAILURE HANDLING: If scaffold generation fails, check component props and Enhanced scaffold system

node -e "
const { createEnhancedScaffold } = require('./test/utils/scaffold-templates/create-enhanced-scaffold.js');
const components = [
  { name: 'T-1.2.2:ELE-1', type: 'server', props: {"title":"Test T-1.2.2:ELE-1 for T-1.2.2","children":"Test content for T-1.2.2:ELE-1 in T-1.2.2"} },
  { name: 'T-1.2.2:ELE-2', type: 'server', props: {"title":"Test T-1.2.2:ELE-2 for T-1.2.2","children":"Test content for T-1.2.2:ELE-2 in T-1.2.2"} }
];

async function generateAllScaffolds() {
  for (const component of components) {
    try {
      const path = await createEnhancedScaffold({ task: 'T-1.2.2', component: component.name, props: component.props });
      console.log('✓', component.name, '(' + component.type + ')', 'scaffold created:', path);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('✗', component.name, 'scaffold failed:', error.message);
      throw error;
    }
  }
  console.log('All T-1.2.2 scaffolds generated');
}

generateAllScaffolds().catch(console.error);
"
```

#### Step 1.4: Validate Scaffold Content Quality
```bash
# PURPOSE: Verify scaffolds contain real React content with Tailwind CSS styling and proper component boundaries
# WHEN: Run this after scaffold generation to ensure quality before testing phases
# PREREQUISITES: Enhanced scaffolds generated in test/scaffolds/T-1.2.2/
