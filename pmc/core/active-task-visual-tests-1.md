# T-3.1.1: Button Component Setup and Type Definitions - Visual Testing Protocol

## Mission Statement
Execute complete visual testing cycle from generating screenshots through visual validation with LLM Vision analysis to ensure T-3.1.1 components (T-3.1.1:ELE-1, T-3.1.1:ELE-2, T-3.1.1:ELE-3) are properly implemented, styled, and functioning with component functionality.

## Fix/Test/Analyze Cycle Pattern
For any failed validation step in ANY phase:
1. **Log Issue**: Document failure details and error messages
2. **Attempt Fix**: Apply automated correction if possible  
3. **Re-run Test**: Execute the failed step again
4. **Evaluate Results**: Check if issue is resolved
5. **Update Artifacts**: Regenerate affected files (scaffolds, screenshots, reports)
6. **Repeat**: Continue until success or maximum iterations reached (default: 3 attempts)


## Phase 3: Visual Testing

### Prerequisites (builds on Phase 2)
- Component discovery and classification complete from Phase 1
- Unit testing complete from Phase 2
- Enhanced scaffolds generated for all T-3.1.1 components
- Test server running on port 3333
- Scaffolds contain real React content with styling

### Actions

#### Step 3.1: Execute Enhanced Visual Testing for T-3.1.1
```bash
# PURPOSE: Capture pixel-perfect screenshots of all T-3.1.1 components using Playwright
# WHEN: Run this after unit testing and scaffold generation to create visual testing artifacts
# PREREQUISITES: Enhanced scaffolds exist, test server running, Playwright installed
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: High-quality PNG screenshots captured for all 3 T-3.1.1 components
# FAILURE HANDLING: If visual testing fails, restart test server and check scaffold accessibility

npm run test:visual:enhanced T-3.1.1
```

#### Step 3.2: Validate Screenshot Generation
```bash
# PURPOSE: Verify all expected T-3.1.1 component screenshots were successfully captured
# WHEN: Run this after visual testing to confirm all artifacts are ready for LLM Vision analysis
# PREREQUISITES: Visual testing completed, test/screenshots/T-3.1.1/ directory exists
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: 3 PNG screenshot files confirmed for T-3.1.1 components
# FAILURE HANDLING: If screenshots missing, re-run visual testing for missing components

node -e "
const fs = require('fs');
const screenshotDir = 'test/screenshots/T-3.1.1';
const expectedComponents = ['T-3.1.1:ELE-1', 'T-3.1.1:ELE-2', 'T-3.1.1:ELE-3'];

if (!fs.existsSync(screenshotDir)) {
  throw new Error('Screenshot directory not found: ' + screenshotDir);
}

const screenshots = fs.readdirSync(screenshotDir).filter(f => f.endsWith('.png'));
console.log('Generated screenshots:', screenshots.length);

let allValid = true;
expectedComponents.forEach(component => {
  const fileName = component + '-enhanced.png';
  if (screenshots.includes(fileName)) {
    console.log('✓', component, 'screenshot captured');
  } else {
    console.log('✗', component, 'screenshot missing');
    allValid = false;
  }
});

if (!allValid) {
  throw new Error('Some T-3.1.1 component screenshots are missing');
}
console.log('All T-3.1.1 component screenshots validated');
"
```

#### Step 3.3: Validate Component Boundaries in Screenshots
```bash
# PURPOSE: Verify visual boundaries are properly displayed in enhanced scaffolds
# WHEN: Run this after screenshot validation to ensure component classification is visually clear
# PREREQUISITES: Enhanced scaffolds exist with component boundary styling
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: Server components show blue boundaries, client components show green boundaries
# FAILURE HANDLING: If boundaries missing, regenerate scaffolds with proper boundary injection


```

### Validation
- [ ] All 3 T-3.1.1 component screenshots captured
- [ ] Screenshots are high-quality PNG files
- [ ] Server components display blue visual boundaries
- [ ] Client components display green visual boundaries
- [ ] Tailwind CSS styling visible in screenshots

### Deliverables
- 3 PNG screenshot files in test/screenshots/T-3.1.1/

node -e "
const { EnhancedLLMVisionAnalyzer } = require('./test/utils/vision/enhanced-llm-vision-analyzer');
async function testConnection() {
  try {
    const analyzer = new EnhancedLLMVisionAnalyzer({ verbose: false });
    await analyzer.initialize();
    console.log('✓ Enhanced LLM Vision Analyzer API connection successful');
    await analyzer.close();
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('✗ Enhanced LLM Vision Analyzer connection failed:', error.message);
    throw error;
  }
}
testConnection();
"
```

#### Step 4.2: Execute Enhanced LLM Vision Analysis for All T-3.1.1 Components
```bash
# PURPOSE: Run Enhanced LLM Vision analysis on each T-3.1.1 component to validate content and classification
# WHEN: Run this after screenshot validation to get comprehensive component analysis
# PREREQUISITES: Screenshots exist, Enhanced LLM Vision Analyzer configured, task context available
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: Detailed analysis reports with 95%+ confidence scores for all components
# FAILURE HANDLING: If analysis fails or confidence low, apply fix/test/analyze cycle
# NOTE: 60-second delay between analyses prevents API rate limiting and ensures reliable processing

COMPONENTS=("T-3.1.1:ELE-1" "T-3.1.1:ELE-2" "T-3.1.1:ELE-3")

for component in "${COMPONENTS[@]}"; do
  echo "Analyzing ${component} component..."
  node test/utils/vision/enhanced-llm-vision-analyzer.js "$component" || echo "RETRY: Analysis failed for ${component}"
  
  # Wait 60 seconds between analyses to prevent API rate limiting
  if [ "$component" != "T-3.1.1:ELE-3" ]; then
    echo "⏱️ Waiting 60 seconds before next analysis to prevent rate limiting..."
    sleep 60
  fi
done
```

#### Step 4.3: Validate LLM Vision Analysis Results
```bash
# PURPOSE: Verify all T-3.1.1 components have comprehensive analysis reports with acceptable confidence scores
# WHEN: Run this after component analysis to ensure all deliverables are complete
# PREREQUISITES: Enhanced LLM Vision analysis completed for all components
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: 3 detailed analysis reports confirmed in test/screenshots/T-3.1.1/
# FAILURE HANDLING: If reports missing or confidence low, re-run analysis with improved prompts

COMPONENTS=("T-3.1.1:ELE-1" "T-3.1.1:ELE-2" "T-3.1.1:ELE-3")

for component in "${COMPONENTS[@]}"; do
  report_path="test/screenshots/T-3.1.1/${component}-enhanced-analysis.md"
  if [ -f "$report_path" ]; then
    echo "✓ ${component} Enhanced LLM Vision report: $report_path"

## Testing Tools and Infrastructure
- **Testing Tools**: Jest, TypeScript, React Testing Library
- **Coverage Requirements**: 90% code coverage
- **Implementation Location**: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-modern-1\components\design-system\atoms\Button\`
- **Enhanced Testing Infrastructure**: aplio-modern-1/test with utilities in test/utils/

## Important Notes

**DO**: Follow `pmc\core\active-task-visual-tests-1.md` precisely
**DO**: Validate all T-3.1.1 specific requirements (variants, sizes, DSAP compliance)
**DO**: Use the Fix/Test/Analyze cycle for any failures
**DO**: Focus exclusively on Button component testing

- Always run this script from the `project_root\pmc` directory
- New bash shells ALWAYS open in `project_root\pmc` by default. Navigate accordingly when you start a new shell
- The main folders: `project_root\aplio-modern-1` and `project_root\pmc` are adjacent to each other. To navigate from one to the other you need to first do cd .. 
- Always append ` | cat` to all bash terminal commands. The cat command reads all input and then terminates cleanly when the input stream closes. This helps commands not to hang.
- Use the simplest terminal commands that will still get the job done. Compound commands have a tendency to hang even with ` | cat` on the end.
