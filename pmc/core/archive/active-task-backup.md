## Task Approach

### Current Approach (Added: 04/27/2025, 12:55:57 AM)

Overview:
Will initialize Next.js 14 project with TypeScript using create-next-app, establish App Router architecture, and configure essential project settings for optimal performance and development workflow.

Implementation Strategy:
1. Project Setup and Core Dependencies
   * Use create-next-app to bootstrap Next.js 14 project with TypeScript
   * Install and configure essential dependencies for development
   * Verify proper installation by running development server

2. App Router Structure Configuration
   * Configure next.config.js for App Router architecture
   * Set up essential project settings for development workflow
   * Ensure TypeScript configuration is properly established

3. Project Root Files Setup
   * Create comprehensive .gitignore file for Next.js project
   * Generate detailed README.md with project overview and setup instructions
   * Establish .env.example file with necessary environment variables

Key Considerations:
* Ensure TypeScript is properly configured with strict type checking
* App Router must replace Pages Router for modern Next.js architecture
* Configure for optimal development experience with proper linting
* Set up environment variable structure for future configuration needs
* Ensure proper Next.js 14 feature compatibility

### Approach History

## Expected Implementation Files

Primary:
- aplio-modern-1/package.json
  - aplio-modern-1/next.config.js
  - aplio-modern-1/tsconfig.json
- Additional files:
  - aplio-modern-1/.gitignore
  - aplio-modern-1/README.md
  - aplio-modern-1/.env.example
  - aplio-modern-1/app/page.tsx
  - aplio-modern-1/app/layout.tsx
When you discover or add an implementation file, you MUST call:
```
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js add-implementation-file "<file_path>" <is_primary>
```
Then paste the command output here.

Additional Files:
- aplio-modern-1/package.json (Added: 04/27/2025, 01:00:42 AM)

## Element States and Transitions
### Valid State Transitions
- Not Started → In Progress: Begins when implementation of an element starts
- In Progress → Unit Testing: Occurs when implementation and validation phases are complete
- Unit Testing → Complete - Unit Test Successful: Applied when all unit tests pass
- Unit Testing → Complete - Unit Test Incomplete: Used when unit tests don't all pass but development proceeds per operator instructions
- In Progress → Abandoned: Applied when operator determines the element should be skipped

### Associated Actions

When transitioning to "Complete - Unit Test Incomplete":
- Document test failures and reasons
- Call update-element-status command with "Complete - Unit Test Incomplete" parameter
- Note limitations in implementation
- Mark for potential future improvement

When transitioning to "Abandoned":
- Document rationale for abandonment
- Call update-element-status command with "Abandoned" parameter

- Ensure proper type checking and type compatibility
- Maintain basic ESLint rule compliance
- Verify correct import/export patterns
- Use consistent naming conventions across the codebase
- Meet test coverage thresholds
- Implement proper component prop validation
- Apply consistent error handling patterns

  ```
  Then paste the command output here.

### Validation Phase
When you have completed all implementation steps, proceed to the Validation Phase by:
1. Reading the companion test file: core/active-task-unit-tests.md
2. Following the test file creation, implementation, and execution steps
3. Recording all test results in that file
4. Reporting coverage metrics and addressing any test failures

Test Failure Strategy:
- Document all test failures with error messages and stack traces
- For each failure, implement fixes in the corresponding implementation file
- Rerun failed tests until they pass
- If a test cannot be fixed after 3 attempts, document the issue and proceed only if it doesn't affect critical functionality
- Log all test failures using the error command:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "<error description>" <severity 1-10>
  ```
  Example error logs:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Type error in button component" 7
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Critical performance issue" 9
  ```

Do NOT proceed to the Validation Phase until all elements in the Implementation Phase are complete.

- [x] [VAL-1] Run tests for project initialization (implements ELE-1) (Status: Complete, Updated: 04/27/2025, 01:09:45 AM)

## Testing Overview
Testing for this task is managed in a separate file to reduce cognitive load and ensure comprehensive test implementation.

- Test Location: 
- Testing Tools: 
- Coverage Requirements: 

After completing the Implementation Phase, you MUST:
1. Open and read core/active-task-unit-tests.md
2. Follow all testing instructions in that file
3. Execute all tests and verify coverage requirements are met

Test execution will follow the same element structure as implementation:
- T-1.1.1:ELE-1: Project initialization: Set up Next.js 14 project with TypeScript support
- T-1.1.1:ELE-2: Base configuration: Configure essential Next.js settings and dependencies

When all tests are complete, you MUST return to this file to complete the task.

- pmc/product/06-aplio-mod-1-tasks.md (for detailed task specifications)
- pmc/core/progress.md (for overall project progress)

### Prior Task and its Current Status
Prior Task: None
Task Title: None
Task Details: pmc\product\06-aplio-mod-1-tasks.md starts on line N/A

### Next Task in Sequence
Next Task: T-1.1.2
Task Title: App Router Directory Structure Implementation
Task Details: pmc\product\06-aplio-mod-1-tasks.md starts on line 58
Is this task dependent on the current task? No

### New Dependencies
When implementing this task, if you identify a dependency requirement that meets BOTH criteria:
1. Not documented in the Task Information section
2. Not already implemented in the codebase

You MUST document this dependency by executing:
```
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js log-dependency "[task-id]" "[detailed dependency specification]"
```
Your dependency specification should include:
- What the dependency is (library, component, service, etc.)
- Why it's necessary for the current task
- How it impacts the implementation approach

After logging the dependency, paste the command output here and await human operator guidance before proceeding with implementation that relies on this dependency.

### Improvement Suggestions
During implementation, if you identify potential improvements that would enhance:
- Code quality or maintainability
- System flexibility or extensibility
- Feature capabilities or user experience
- Performance or security characteristics

You MUST document these insights by executing:
```
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js log-improvement "[task-id]" "[improvement specification]"
```
Your improvement specification should:
- Clearly articulate the proposed enhancement
- Provide a technical rationale for the suggestion
- Indicate the scope of impact (localized or system-wide)
- Note whether the improvement is critical or could be implemented later

After logging the improvement, paste the command output here, notify the human operator, and continue with your current task implementation.

IMPORTANT OPERATIONAL INSTRUCTIONS:

As you code this task, every 750 output tokens you MUST:
1. Read the active-task.md file to refresh context
2. Return back to what you were doing if it is contributing to the current task
3. If you are working on code that does not contribute to the current task, send a high priority alert to the human operator

As you code this task, every 1000 output tokens you MUST read the Task Approach section of the current active-task.md:
1. If the approach is still valid, continue coding
2. If the approach has new context or details, add an **Addendum** to the Task Approach
3. If the approach has proven to be erroneous, add a **Major Approach Update** with detailed explanation
