## Overview
This file contains testing instructions for task T-1.1.3. 
Do NOT begin testing until you have completed all implementation steps in `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-1\aplio-22-cline\pmc\core\active-task.md`.

- Implementation Location: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-1\aplio-22-cline\aplio-modern-1\app`
- Test Location: `**Test Locations**: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-1\aplio-22-cline\aplio-modern-1\test\unit-tests\task-1-1\T-1.1.3\`
- Testing Tools: Jest, React Testing Library, Next.js Testing Tools, Supertest
- Coverage Requirements: 90% code coverage

### Acceptance Criteria
The following criteria define successful task completion and should be used to verify test coverage:

- Non-interactive components are implemented as server components by default
- Client components are explicitly marked with 'use client' directive
- Server/client component composition follows optimal patterns
- Server components render correctly with expected content

**Testing Directive**: Ensure your tests explicitly verify each of these acceptance criteria. When creating test cases, map them to specific criteria and check that all criteria are covered by at least one test. After completing all tests, verify and document which tests validate each acceptance criterion.

## Test Environment Setup
Before creating or running tests, ensure your environment is ready:

1. Verify Jest and TypeScript testing tools are installed:
   ```bash
   npm list jest typescript ts-jest @types/jest
   ```
   If any are missing, install them:
   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev jest typescript ts-jest @types/jest
   ```

2. Verify the test directory structure exists for this task:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p `**Test Locations**: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-1\aplio-22-cline\aplio-modern-1\test\unit-tests\task-1-1\T-1.1.3\`
   ```

3. Check for a Jest configuration file (`jest.config.js`) in the project root:
   ```bash
   [ -f jest.config.js ] && echo "Jest config exists" || echo "Jest config missing"
   ```
   
4. Ensure your tests will meet the required coverage target of 90% code coverage

5. Verify that all task dependencies are completed:
   ```bash
   node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js check-dependency "T-1.1.2"
   ```

6. Test Failure Strategy:
   - Document all test failures with error messages and stack traces
   - For each failure, implement fixes in the corresponding implementation file
   - Rerun failed tests until they pass
   - If a test cannot be fixed after 3 attempts, document the issue and proceed only if it doesn't affect critical functionality

## Test Planning Workpad

As you develop and execute tests for this task, you may use the dedicated test workpad file at:
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-1\aplio-22-cline\pmc\core\task-work-pad-test.md`

This workpad is your testing sandbox where you can:
- Design complex test cases before formal implementation
- Develop test fixtures and mock data
- Track test failures and debugging steps
- Plan test coverage strategies
- Document edge cases that need testing
- Work through test assertions and expected outcomes
- Track test-specific TODOs as you discover them

Using this workpad is optional but recommended for complex testing scenarios. Nothing written there will be considered final test code - it's purely to assist your testing process.

When using the workpad, consider organizing your entries by element and test case to maintain clarity as you work through the testing requirements.

## Element Tests
### T-1.1.3:ELE-1
**Description**: Server component implementation: Create server components as default for non-interactive parts

**Testing Description**: Test for the successful development of:
- Server component implementation: Create server components as default for non-interactive parts

**Test Requirements**:
  - Verify server components render correctly with expected content
  - Test that server components don't include client-side interactivity code
  - Validate server component data fetching capabilities
  - Ensure server components follow Next.js 14 App Router conventions

**Testing Deliverables**:
  - `server-component-render.test.tsx`: Tests for server component rendering
  - `server-component-data.test.tsx`: Tests for data fetching in server components
  - Static analysis tool to verify absence of client-side code in server components
  - Documentation of server component testing approaches

**Human Verification Items**:
  - Verify server components render correctly in the application
  - Confirm server components don't include unnecessary client JavaScript
  - Validate performance benefits of server components for non-interactive content

### T-1.1.3:ELE-2
**Description**: Client component boundaries: Mark interactive components with 'use client' directive

**Testing Description**: Test for the successful development of:
- Client component boundaries: Mark interactive components with 'use client' directive

**Test Requirements**:
  - Verify client components are correctly marked with 'use client' directive
  - Test client component interactivity with user events
  - Validate proper hydration of client components
  - Ensure client/server component boundaries are optimized

**Testing Deliverables**:
  - `client-directive.test.ts`: Static analysis for 'use client' directive usage
  - `client-interactivity.test.tsx`: Tests for client component event handling
  - `hydration.test.tsx`: Tests for proper client component hydration
  - Documentation of client component boundary testing methodology

**Human Verification Items**:
  - Manually interact with client components to verify functionality
  - Confirm proper hydration by checking for client-side interactivity
  - Verify optimal client/server component boundaries for performance

## Coverage Reporting
After running all tests with coverage, document the results here:

```bash
npx jest --coverage `**Test Locations**: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-1\aplio-22-cline\aplio-modern-1\test\unit-tests\task-1-1\T-1.1.3\`
```

- Overall coverage percentage: (fill in after running tests)
- Coverage by element:
      - T-1.1.3:ELE-1: 0%
    - T-1.1.3:ELE-2: 0%
- Areas needing additional coverage: (identify any areas below target)

If coverage requirements are not met:
1. Identify areas lacking coverage
2. Implement additional tests targeting those areas
3. Rerun tests and verify improved coverage

## Test Result Summary
- [ ] All tests have been executed
- [ ] All tests have passed
- [ ] Coverage requirements have been met
- [ ] Test failures have been documented and addressed
- [ ] Test fixtures have been properly managed

When all tests are complete, return to core/active-task.md to complete the task.
