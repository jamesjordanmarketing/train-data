# Command Engine - Project Overview

## Executive Summary

The Command Engine is a validation and enforcement framework designed to solve the critical problem of context loss in AI-assisted development. By monitoring conversation context, enforcing command execution, and providing structured validation, it ensures that important development steps are not missed during complex implementation processes.

The system consists of two major components:
1. **Core Command Engine** - Monitors and enforces command execution based on conversation context
2. **PMC Specification Command Engine** - Extends the core engine to automate the creation of project specifications

This document provides an overview of both components, their architecture, and implementation guidance to enable development after any period of inactivity.

## Problem Statement

### Context Loss in AI-Assisted Development

AI-assisted development with tools like Claude in Cursor is powerful but vulnerable to context loss:

1. **Task Transitions**: Moving between tasks without proper documentation
2. **File Operations**: Creating or modifying files without tracking changes
3. **Decision Points**: Making implementation decisions without recording rationale
4. **Required Commands**: Missing critical logging or tracking commands
5. **Conversation Disconnect**: Losing track of what has already been discussed or decided

These issues lead to:
- Fragmented project documentation
- Inconsistent implementation
- Loss of decision history
- Inefficient repetition of work
- Degraded AI assistance quality over time

## Solution: The Command Engine Framework

The Command Engine addresses these issues through:

1. **Conversation Monitoring**: Tracks conversation context to detect task transitions, file operations, and context changes
2. **Command Registry**: Maintains a registry of required commands and tracks execution status
3. **Validation System**: Ensures critical commands are executed at the right times
4. **Checkpoint Mechanism**: Regularly validates system state and reconciles missed commands
5. **User Interface**: Provides clear warnings and recommendations

## Detailed Component Descriptions

### Core Command Engine

1. **Command Registry (`registry.js`)**
   - Tracks all required commands with execution history
   - Determines command relevance based on context
   - Identifies and reports missed commands

2. **Conversation Monitor (`monitor.js`)**
   - Analyzes conversation to detect context changes
   - Identifies task transitions, file operations, etc.
   - Generates pending commands based on detected events

3. **Validators (`validator.js`)**
   - Pre-response validator ensures required commands are executed
   - Post-action reconciliation verifies command execution
   - Prevents proceeding when critical commands are missing

4. **Checkpoint Mechanism (`checkpoint.js`)**
   - Runs periodic validations at token count thresholds
   - Creates action plans for missed commands
   - Maintains system health metrics

5. **User Interface (`interface.js`)**
   - Generates user-facing warnings and recommendations
   - Formats information about command status
   - Provides guidance for required actions

### PMC Spec Command Engine

1. **Spec Engine (`spec-engine.js`)**
   - Orchestrates the specification generation pipeline
   - Manages dependencies between specification artifacts
   - Tracks completion status of each stage

2. **Prompt Manager (`spec-pipeline/prompt-manager.js`)**
   - Loads prompt templates from `_prompt_engineering/` directory
   - Fills templates with project-specific variables
   - Prepares prompts for API submission

3. **API Wrapper (`spec-pipeline/api-wrapper.js`)**
   - Connects to Claude API for prompt processing
   - Handles authentication and rate limiting
   - Manages conversation context and history

4. **Specification Validator (`spec-pipeline/validator.js`)**
   - Ensures generated specifications meet quality standards
   - Validates cross-references between documents
   - Checks completeness and formatting

## Implementation Guide

### Required Specifications

Before beginning implementation, the following specifications are needed:

1. **Command Registry Schema**
   - Definition of command objects
   - Execution history structure
   - Command dependency relationships

2. **Context Detection Patterns**
   - Regular expressions for task IDs, file paths, etc.
   - Event triggers and associated commands
   - Context transition rules

3. **Validation Rules**
   - Critical vs. non-critical commands
   - Token count thresholds
   - Reconciliation policies

4. **API Integration Specifications**
   - Authentication parameters
   - Rate limiting strategy
   - Error handling approach

5. **User Interface Guidelines**
   - Warning formats and thresholds
   - Recommendation presentation
   - Status reporting structure

**Request to Product Management**: Please provide detailed specifications for each of these areas before implementation begins. The most critical specification is the Command Registry Schema as it forms the foundation of the entire system.

### Implementation Steps

   - Implement basic commands: status, validate, register, checkpoint

4. **PMC Integration**
   - Implement `integration.js` with PMC hooks
   - Test with existing PMC commands

5. **Spec Engine**

## Getting Started

To begin working on this project after a period of inactivity:

1. **Review Documentation**
   - Read this overview document
   - Review `OPERATION_GUIDE.md` for operational details
   - Study `description--pmc-spec-command-engine.md` for specification automation

2. **Check Current State**
   - Run `node pmc/command-engine/cli.js status` if available
   - Review existing implementation in the codebase
   - Check for any pending specifications

3. **Set Up Development Environment**
   - Ensure Node.js is installed (v14+ recommended)
   - Set environment variables for API access if implementing spec engine
   - Clone the repository and navigate to the project root

4. **Start Implementation**
   - Begin with the core components if not already implemented
   - Focus on one component at a time, following the dependency order
   - Create unit tests alongside each component

## Open Questions

1. How should the Command Engine integrate with different AI frameworks beyond Cursor?
2. What is the preferred approach for persistent storage of command history?
3. Should the system support custom command definitions via configuration files?
4. What level of human intervention is preferred for specification generation?
5. How should the Command Engine handle conflicting commands or contexts?

## Next Steps

1. Obtain detailed specifications for the Command Registry Schema
2. Define exact integration points with the existing PMC system
3. Develop a proof-of-concept for the core Command Engine
4. Create a testing strategy for context monitoring
5. Design the user interface for warnings and recommendations

## Conclusion

The Command Engine represents a significant advancement in AI-assisted development by ensuring context preservation and command execution tracking. Its dual focus on core command validation and specification automation addresses critical needs in complex development workflows.

By implementing this system, we can dramatically improve the consistency, traceability, and quality of development while reducing context loss and improving long-term maintainability.

========================================================

**Original Question**
ok. now write an overview for the command-engine product.
put it in pmc\command-engine\00-overview-command-engine-pmc.md

Write it as if it was going to be put aside for several weeks and the human will have forgotten the details about it...and where to start and the project to spec and build it.

So include a starting point for it from here

What specs do you need? Ask for them in the document.
Include a file structure graph of the folders layout.

What else should I be telling you to do?
Please proceed. Ask me any questions you have.
