# VS Code Integration with Command Engine and PMC

## Executive Summary

The Command Engine VS Code Extension provides a comprehensive framework for AI-assisted development that integrates directly with Visual Studio Code. By embedding the Command Engine middleware directly into VS Code, we eliminate the limitations of closed AI chat interfaces and enable full automation capabilities with direct API access to Claude Sonnet and other LLMs.

This document describes the architecture and features of the VS Code integration, with special focus on middleware automation, command logging, context preservation, and seamless integration with the Project Memory Core Toolkit (PMCT) system.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Direct LLM API Integration

The Command Engine VS Code extension provides direct access to Claude Sonnet and other LLMs through dedicated middleware:

- **Script-Based AI Interaction**: Submit prompts directly from scripts and programs
- **Middleware Processing**: All AI interactions pass through Command Engine middleware for logging and context tracking
- **Authentication Management**: Secure handling of API keys through VS Code's secrets storage
- **Rate Limiting and Queuing**: Intelligent management of API requests to prevent throttling
- **Response Processing**: Structured handling of LLM responses for automation workflows

Example:
```javascript
// Direct script-based AI interaction
const { submitToLLM } = require('command-engine');

async function generateComponentCode(specs) {
  const result = await submitToLLM({
    prompt: `Generate React component based on these specs: ${JSON.stringify(specs)}`,
    model: 'claude-3-sonnet-20240229',
    contextId: 'component-generation'
  });
  
  return result.generatedCode;
}
```

### 2. Command Engine Middleware

The Command Engine acts as middleware between your development workflow and the LLM:

- **Prompt Interception**: Captures all prompts before they reach the LLM
- **Response Interception**: Processes all LLM responses before returning them
- **Context Tracking**: Maintains conversation and development context
- **Command Validation**: Ensures required commands are executed
- **Automated Logging**: Records all interactions, commands, and context changes

Configuration options include:
- Command criticality levels (critical, high, medium, low)
- Token threshold for checkpoints (default: 500)
- Command reconciliation interval (default: 2000)
- Logging verbosity and storage location
- Context transition detection sensitivity

### 3. VS Code Integration Features

The extension integrates deeply with VS Code to provide a seamless experience:

- **Command Palette Integration**: Access Command Engine functions through the VS Code command palette
- **Dedicated View Container**: View command status, pending commands, and context information
- **Editor Decorations**: Visual indicators for context-aware sections of code
- **Code Lens**: Interactive elements for executing commands in context
- **Status Bar Items**: Quick access to current context and command status
- **Terminal Integration**: Execute and track commands from the integrated terminal
- **Extension API**: Allow other extensions to interact with the Command Engine

### 4. Project Memory Core Toolkit (PMCT) Integration

The Command Engine provides tight integration with the PMCT system for comprehensive project management:

- **Specification Management**: Track and validate specifications throughout the development process
- **User Story Traceability**: Link code to user stories and requirements
- **Task Automation**: Execute tasks based on the project task list
- **Implementation Pattern Application**: Apply predefined patterns to new code
- **Project Structure Enforcement**: Ensure code adheres to defined project structure
- **Status Reporting**: Generate detailed status reports for project stakeholders

### 5. Autonomous Project Building

The extension enables "out of the box" autonomous project building with:

- **End-to-End Traceability**: Track every step from specifications to implementation
- **Status Logging**: Detailed logs of all project activities
- **Action Logging**: Record all actions taken during development
- **Context Awareness**: Maintain and transfer context throughout the project lifecycle
- **Component Interlocking**: Ensure components work together as specified
- **Human Interface Generation**: Create appropriate user interfaces for human interaction
- **Progress Visualization**: Visual representation of project progress

### 6. Intelligent Review System

> *This is the additional module that would fit well with the product.*

The Intelligent Review System enhances the development process by:

- **Code Review Automation**: Automatically review generated code against best practices
- **Consistency Checking**: Ensure consistent patterns across the codebase
- **Security Vulnerability Detection**: Identify potential security issues
- **Performance Impact Analysis**: Estimate performance implications of changes
- **Accessibility Compliance**: Check for accessibility issues in UI components
- **Documentation Verification**: Ensure documentation matches implementation
- **Test Coverage Analysis**: Identify areas needing additional test coverage

The review system integrates with the Command Engine to provide actionable feedback and can automatically generate commands to address identified issues.

## Workflow Examples

### Example 1: Automated Specification Generation

```javascript
// Script to generate functional requirements from user stories
const { commandEngine, pmctTools } = require('command-engine');

async function generateFunctionalRequirements() {
  // Register the action in Command Engine
  commandEngine.registerCommandExecution(
    'node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js start-task "SPEC-FR-GENERATION"'
  );
  
  // Load templates and project data
  const template = await pmctTools.loadPromptTemplate('fr-template.md');
  const userStories = await pmctTools.loadUserStories();
  
  // Process through Command Engine middleware
  const result = await commandEngine.submitToLLM({
    systemPrompt: "You are a technical product manager creating functional requirements.",
    userPrompt: template.replace('{USER_STORIES}', JSON.stringify(userStories)),
    model: 'claude-3-sonnet-20240229',
    maxTokens: 8000
  });
  
  // Save the generated specifications
  await pmctTools.saveFunctionalRequirements(result.content);
  
  // Register completion in Command Engine
  commandEngine.registerCommandExecution(
    'node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js complete-task "SPEC-FR-GENERATION"'
  );
  
  return {
    success: true,
    message: "Functional requirements generated successfully"
  };
}
```

### Example 2: Context-Aware Code Generation

```javascript
// In a VS Code extension command
async function generateComponentFromSpec() {
  // Get current file and context
  const editor = vscode.window.activeTextEditor;
  const document = editor.document;
  
  // Get requirements for the current file from PMCT
  const requirements = await pmctTools.getRequirementsForFile(document.fileName);
  
  // Submit to LLM through Command Engine
  const result = await commandEngine.submitToLLM({
    systemPrompt: "You are a senior software engineer implementing React components.",
    userPrompt: `Create a React component that implements these requirements: ${JSON.stringify(requirements)}`,
    model: 'claude-3-sonnet-20240229',
    contextId: 'component-generation',
    contextData: {
      filePath: document.fileName,
      projectStructure: await pmctTools.getProjectStructure(),
      implementationPatterns: await pmctTools.getImplementationPatterns()
    }
  });
  
  // Insert the generated code
  editor.edit(editBuilder => {
    editBuilder.insert(editor.selection.start, result.generatedCode);
  });
  
  // Log the file modification in Command Engine
  commandEngine.registerCommandExecution(
    `node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js file-modified "${document.fileName}" "Implemented component from requirements"`
  );
}
```

=========================================================

**Original Description**

Ok. now when we build it we are going to build it with the open source from VS Code and what we are going to do is describe the product as if we are going to build our own system on top of VS Code.
You can describe this product here: pmc\command-engine\01-vs-code-integration-with-command-engine-and-pmc.md

1. Allow people to submit directly to the Sonnet API from the scripts and programs in our project. The submits will go through the middleware of Command Engine. That has been the main barrier I have been having with Cursor so far. They don't allow me to submit to the AI LLM's from my scripts. It is only allowed via the cursor chat window.
So in the PMC Command Engine we are going to change that. We will allow full automation via our middleware.
and in addition to the automation via our middleware it will come with the built in command engine that we can setup 

(think about what kind of settings people would want to have in the command logging Command Engine module.

2. So there will be the Command Engine module that will transfer our prompts and script to the AI at the interception points. This will allow for us to create strutured logs, and contexts which we an rely on.

a. The LLM will also send it's responses to our the command engine listeners so they can do the appropriate action before (while?) answering the human or writing project code via the middleware as you have described in: pmc\command-engine\description--mechanical-implementation-of-ai-framework-interception.md

3. Tight integration with our PMCT system which is designed to build a rich mature software product via experienced specifications, user stories, functional requirements, implementation patterns, structure, and ultimately the very detailed task list which is then used as the input for autonomous software builds with appropriate and useful human interfaces.

4. And ultimately "out of the box" project building that is manageable and transparent from the beginning of the software build to the end because of reliable status logging, action logging, context logging and awareness, interlocking components, 

5. Think of one more module that would fit appropriately into this product. Go ahead ad it.
