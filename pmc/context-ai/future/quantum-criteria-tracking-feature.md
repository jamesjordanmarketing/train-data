# Quantum Criteria Tracking (QCT): Atomic-Level Requirement Management in PMC
**Feature Proposal Document**  
**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Date:** February 22, 2025  
**Category:** PMC Core Feature Enhancement

## Executive Summary

Project Memory Core (PMC) revolutionizes software requirements management by treating specifications as quantum systems rather than rigid hierarchies. This document proposes enhancing PMC's quantum framework with Quantum Criteria Tracking (QCT) - a system that manages acceptance criteria at the atomic level while preserving their quantum nature.

## PMC Context & Background

### The Quantum Nature of Requirements
PMC's fundamental innovation is recognizing that software requirements behave like quantum systems:
- Requirements exist in multiple states simultaneously
- Their nature changes when observed
- They exhibit entanglement across different contexts
- They follow uncertainty principles in tracking vs. flexibility

## The Quantum Criteria Tracking Feature

### Problem Statement
While PMC successfully manages requirements at the quantum level, acceptance criteria currently lack atomic-level tracking, leading to:
- Loss of criteria during requirement reorganization
- Unclear traceability in distributed requirements
- Difficulty in tracking criteria evolution
- Challenges in maintaining criteria integrity

### Solution: Quantum Criteria Identifiers (QCI)
We propose implementing atomic-level tracking through Quantum Criteria Identifiers. Each acceptance criterion receives a unique identifier that preserves its quantum properties while enabling precise tracking.

### Tracking Options Analysis

#### Option 1: Section-Dependent Quantum States
```
FR4.1.0:AC1 -> Resets with each section
FR4.1.0:AC1.1 -> Sub-quantum states possible
```

**Advantages:**
- Clear hierarchical representation
- Intuitive numbering system
- Easy to understand structure
- Maintains section context

**Disadvantages:**
- State changes affect all dependent criteria
- Historical tracking becomes complex
- Potential for confusion during reorganization
- Higher maintenance overhead

#### Option 2: Persistent Quantum Numbers
```
FR4.1.0:AC42 -> Number persists regardless of location
FR4.1.0:AC42.1 -> Sub-states maintain parent number
```

**Advantages:**
- Immutable tracking through system lifetime
- Simplified audit capabilities
- Reliable historical tracking
- Independent of organizational changes

**Disadvantages:**
- Numbers lose contextual meaning
- Potential for large number spaces
- More complex initial assignment
- May seem arbitrary to users

#### Option 3: Origin-Anchored Quantum Identifiers
```
US12.2.0:ACC4 -> Original source-based identifier
T-3.1.0:ACC2 -> Task-originated criterion
```

**Advantages:**
- Preserves origin context
- Provides implicit history
- Supports multi-source tracking
- Maintains quantum entanglement information

**Disadvantages:**
- Longer identifiers
- Initial learning curve
- More complex parsing needs
- Storage overhead

### Recommended Approach: Option 3

We recommend implementing Origin-Anchored Quantum Identifiers because:

1. **Quantum Consistency**
   - Maintains PMC's quantum mechanics metaphor
   - Preserves entanglement information
   - Supports uncertainty principle in practice
   - Allows for quantum state observation

2. **Practical Benefits**
   - Never loses historical context
   - Supports audit requirements
   - Enables precise tracking
   - Facilitates requirement archaeology

3. **Commercial Value**
   - Enhances PMC's unique value proposition
   - Strengthens quantum framework story
   - Provides competitive differentiation
   - Enables advanced analytics
