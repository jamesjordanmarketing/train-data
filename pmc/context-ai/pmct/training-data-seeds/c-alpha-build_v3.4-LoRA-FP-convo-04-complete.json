The average homeowner either sells and moves or refinances within 7-10 years. So you're not signing away your life—you're making a decision that you can adjust if your circumstances change.\n\nAnd all those 'what ifs' you listed? Those are the *right* questions to ask. You're not spiraling—you're thinking through risks, which is smart. The good news is: every single one of those scenarios has practical answers.\n\nBefore we dive into them, can I ask: what's making you look at houses right now? Is it just the social pressure about 'throwing money away,' or is there something about your current living situation that's not working?",

Here's some context that might help: 2006-2008 was a very specific situation—banks were giving mortgages to people who couldn't afford them, with almost no money down and no income verification. It was called the subprime crisis for a reason.\n\nYou're in a completely different situation: stable job, significant income, and presumably you'd put down at least 10-20% and have reserves. The lending standards now are much stricter—in some ways, it's harder to get a mortgage now, which actually makes the system safer.\n\nAnd here's something about the 'huge mistake' fear: buying a house isn't usually a binary success or failure. It's more like... if you buy a reasonable house in a decent area that you can afford, the worst case is usually 'we break even when we sell' or 'we made a little less than we hoped'—not financial ruin.

      "target_response": "Great questions. Let's tackle them one at a time.\n\n**Job loss scenario:** This is where your emergency fund comes in. If you're paying $2,400/month in rent now and a mortgage would be similar, you'd want 6 months of expenses saved—that's about $25K-$30K total (includes mortgage, food, utilities, etc.). With that cushion, if you lost your job, you'd have 6 months to find new work. Plus, unemployment benefits would cover about 50% of your income, stretching that timeline even further. And in a true emergency, you could also pause or reduce retirement contributions temporarily. You're not as trapped as it feels.\n\n**Repair costs:** Yes, big repairs happen—but not as often or as immediately as the horror stories suggest. Most major systems (HVAC, roof, water heater) last 15-25 years. When you buy, you'd get a home inspection that tells you the age and condition of everything. If the roof is 20 years old, you know to budget for replacement within 5 years. It's not a surprise ambush.\n\nThe rule of thumb is to budget 1-2% of home value per year for maintenance and repairs. On a $400K house, that's $4K-$8K/year, or about $350-$650/month. Not all of it gets spent every year—some years it's just filters and gutters, some years it's a water heater. But having that fund means you're prepared.\n\nDoes that make the what-ifs feel more manageable?",

Depending on your price range, that's enough for 10-15% down on a $300K-$400K house, plus some closing costs. Here's the sequence I'd recommend:\n\n**Step 1: Get pre-approved for a mortgage.** This tells you exactly how much you can borrow and makes you a serious buyer. It's free, doesn't commit you to anything, and takes about a week. You'll need pay stubs, tax returns, and bank statements.\n\n**Step 2: Figure out your real budget.** Pre-approval tells you what you *can* borrow, but you need to decide what you're comfortable paying monthly. Use the 28% rule as a starting point: your total housing costs shouldn't exceed 28% of your gross income. For you, that's about $3,400/month maximum—which leaves room in your budget for life.\n\n**Step 3: Start looking, but slowly.** Go to open houses, get a feel for neighborhoods, see what $400K actually gets you. This isn't a race. You're learning what matters to you.\n\n**Step 4: Build your reserves while you look.** If you're targeting a 15% down payment ($60K on a $400K house), you'd need another $20K. Plus you want 6 months emergency fund. If you can save $2K/month, that's 10 months away—which is actually a healthy timeline for finding the right house anyway.\n\nDoes that feel like a manageable path?",
