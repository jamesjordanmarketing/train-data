      "current_user_input": "I've been trying to figure out life insurance for three weeks now and I feel like I'm drowning. I'm a single parent, so if something happens to me, my kids need to be taken care of. But there are so many options—term versus whole life versus universal life, 20-year term versus 30-year, different coverage amounts. I've read that you should have 10x your salary, but also that you should calculate it based on your debts and future expenses, and then there are articles saying most people are over-insured. I have spreadsheets. I've talked to three different insurance agents and they all say different things. I'm so worried I'm going to pick the wrong thing and my kids will either be under-protected or I'll be wasting money I could use for their college funds. How do I know what's right?",

Life insurance *is* confusing, and the fact that you've researched this much shows how seriously you're taking your kids' security. But you're right: you've hit information overload, and more research isn't going to help at this point. So I'm going to give you a clear answer.\n\n**For your situation (single parent, 42, two young kids, $120K income), here's what you need:**\n\n**Type:** Term life insurance. Not whole life, not universal life—just term. Those other types are investment products wrapped in insurance, and they're expensive and complicated. You don't need them. Term is simple: you pay a premium, and if you die during the term, your beneficiaries get the money. That's it.\n\n**Amount:** $1 million (about 8x your salary). Here's the thinking: This would cover your kids until they're independent adults. $1M invested conservatively generates about $40K-$50K/year, which combined with Social Security survivor benefits would replace your income until they're 18. After that, there'd still be money for college and a safety net.\n\n**Term length:** 20 years. Your youngest is 8, so in 20 years she'll be 28—fully independent. If you die after that, your kids won't need your income replacement anymore.\n\n**Cost:** For a healthy 42-year-old woman, a $1M 20-year term policy costs about $50-$70/month. That's about $600-$800/year.\n\nThat's it. That's your answer. You don't need spreadsheets or three more opinions. This is the standard recommendation for someone in your situation, and it's solid.\n\nDoes that feel like a clear path forward?",

The 'cash value' is a trap for most people. You're essentially paying much higher premiums (often 5-10x more than term) to build a savings account with terrible returns. If you want to save money, you can do that way more effectively in your own investment accounts. For you, term is absolutely the right call.\n\n**Here's how to get it:**\n\n1. **Use an online broker like PolicyGenius, Bestow, or Haven Life.** These sites let you compare multiple insurance companies at once. You enter your info, and they show you quotes from 10-15 insurers. Takes about 10 minutes.\n\n2. **Apply through them.** Once you pick a policy, you apply online. They'll ask health questions, and most companies will require a quick medical exam (they send a nurse to your home or office—takes 20 minutes, free).\n\n3. **Your high blood pressure:** Controlled blood pressure with medication is super common. It'll likely put you in a 'standard' or 'preferred' risk class instead of 'preferred plus.' That means you might pay $60-$80/month instead of $50-$70. It's not a dealbreaker, just a bit more expensive. Some insurers are more lenient than others, which is why comparing multiple is smart.\n\n4. **Timeline:** From application to approval usually takes 4-6 weeks because of the medical exam and underwriting.\n\nThat's it. You're looking at maybe an hour of your time total to get this done. Does that feel manageable?",
