      "target_response": "First, let me say this directly: you haven't failed your kids. You went through a divorce that 'wiped you out financially'—your first priority was stability and rebuilding. That's not failing as a parent; that's succeeding at what mattered most in that moment. College savings had to wait, and that's completely understandable.\n\nAnd here's something you might not know: starting college savings when kids are in elementary or middle school is actually more common than you'd think. Not everyone starts when their kids are babies—that's just what people talk about. Many, many parents start late due to divorces, job losses, medical expenses, or just not being in a financial position earlier. You're not behind some universal timeline.\n\nNow, is it worth starting with 7 years until college? Absolutely yes. Let me show you why with real numbers:\n\nIf you can save $500/month for 7 years (until your oldest goes to college), and it grows at 6% annually, you'd have about $50,000. That's a year of tuition at many state schools, or two years at a community college. Is that a full ride? No. But it's $50,000 your kids *won't* have to borrow. That makes a real difference in their post-graduation life.\n\nStarting now isn't a failure—it's actually a really smart move. Because here's the thing: college costs can be managed with a combination of savings, financial aid, student working part-time, and some reasonable loans. It's not all-or-nothing. Anything you can contribute reduces the debt they'd otherwise carry.\n\nBefore we talk about 529s or where to save, can I ask: what do you think you could realistically contribute each month without straining your budget?",

Don't underestimate that.\n\n**For $400/month with two kids:**\nYes, open separate 529s for each child. Here's how I'd split it: $250/month for your 11-year-old (7 years until college), $150/month for your 8-year-old (10 years until college). The older one needs more urgent saving since there's less time for growth. When you can increase to $500, maybe go $300/$200.\n\n**How 529s work (simple version):**\nA 529 is a special savings account for education. Here's what makes it good:\n1. **Money grows tax-free.** If you put in $400/month and it grows to $50K over 7 years, you don't pay capital gains taxes on that growth. In a regular investment account, you'd owe taxes on the gains.\n2. **Withdrawals for education are tax-free.** When you take money out for tuition, room, board, books—no taxes. That means more of your money goes to college costs instead of the IRS.\n\nFor you specifically, that tax benefit might save you $5K-$8K over the years compared to just using a regular savings or investment account. Not huge, but it's thousands more for your kids' education.\n\n**How to set it up:**\nMost states have their own 529 plan, and you can usually open one online in about 30 minutes. You'll pick an 'age-based portfolio' which automatically gets more conservative as your kid gets closer to college (like a target-date fund for retirement). Super simple.\n\nDoes that make sense?",

Or you can withdraw the money for non-education purposes, but you'll pay income tax on the gains plus a 10% penalty. So if you put in $40K and it grew to $50K, you'd pay taxes and penalty on the $10K growth, not the whole $50K. It's not ideal, but you're not losing everything.\n\n**If they get scholarships:**\nThis is actually covered! If your child receives a scholarship, you can withdraw up to the scholarship amount from the 529 penalty-free (you still pay income tax on the gains, but no 10% penalty). So if your daughter gets a $20K scholarship, you can pull out $20K to use for other expenses or give to her for living costs.\n\n**The bigger picture:**\nI get the concern about 'locking money away,' but here's how I'd frame it: if your kids get scholarships, that's a success story, not a problem. And if they choose not to go to college, you have 10+ years to adjust course—you could stop contributing, move money to a sibling, or use it for trade school or certifications (which 529s also cover).\n\nThe odds that you'll regret saving for their education are pretty low. The odds that they'll be grateful not to graduate with $50K in debt? Pretty high.\n\nYou're making a smart, loving decision. Does that address your concern?",

That's wisdom.\n\nAnd you're absolutely right: starting now is infinitely better than never starting. Your kids are going to have $40K-$50K less debt because you made this decision today instead of putting it off for another year 'until the timing is perfect.' That matters.\n\nYou're not a terrible parent—you're a parent who survived a divorce, rebuilt financial stability, and is now actively planning for your kids' futures. That's the opposite of failure. That's resilience and love in action.\n\nYour weekend plan is perfect. Open those two 529s, set up automatic contributions of $250 and $150, and then you're done. One hour this weekend, and your kids' college futures get significantly brighter.\n\nIf questions come up during the setup or you want to check in down the road, reach out. You've got this.\n\nAnd hey—your kids are lucky to have you.",
