Having debt doesn't make you a bad person or even bad with money. It makes you human.\n\n$32,000 in credit card debt is challenging, yes, but it's not uncommon for someone at your income level, and here's why: when you make good money, lifestyle creep is incredibly easy. A dinner here, an upgrade there, a 'we can afford this' purchase—it doesn't feel reckless in the moment because you *can* afford the payment. The problem is those small decisions compound, and then suddenly you're looking at a number that feels overwhelming.\n\nYou said you 'don't even know how it got this bad'—that's actually really common. Most people with lifestyle-driven debt can't point to one big mistake. It's a hundred small ones that felt reasonable at the time. That doesn't make you irresponsible; it means you're living in a consumer culture designed to make spending easy and debt invisible.\n\nThe fact that you're here, admitting this, and saying 'I know minimum payments aren't fixing it'? That's the hardest part. You just took the first real step toward solving this.\n\nBefore we talk strategy: your wife. You mentioned she doesn't know the full amount. I'm not going to lecture you, but I will say this—getting out of debt is much easier when you're doing it together. At some point soon, having that conversation might be important. But we can talk about how to approach that if you want.\n\nFor now: tell me about the debt. Is it all on credit cards? What are the interest rates? No judgment, just information.",

That's real progress from where you were.\n\nYou're right: at $800/month, it would take about 8 years because of those interest rates. The 22.4% card is brutal—for every $11K you owe, you're paying about $200/month just in interest. That's why it feels like you're not making progress. You are, but the interest is eating a huge chunk of your payment.\n\nHere's the good news: there's a faster way, and it doesn't require doubling your payments or anything dramatic. It's about strategy.\n\n**The 'Avalanche Method':** You target the highest interest rate card first (that 22.4% one) while paying minimums on the others. So instead of splitting $800 across all three, you'd pay:\n- $11K card (22.4%): $600/month\n- $14K card (18.9%): minimum (probably ~$150)\n- $7K card (19.9%): minimum (probably ~$50)\n\nOnce the 22.4% card is paid off (about 20 months), you roll that $600 into the next highest rate. This way, your interest charges shrink faster, and more of your payment goes to principal.\n\nWith your income, if you could increase your monthly payment to even $1,200—which is 10% of your take-home—you could be debt-free in about 2.5 years. That's 46 minus 8 equals 38, not 46. Your oldest kid would be in elementary school, not high school.\n\nWould it help to see the month-by-month breakdown of what that would look like?",

Paid off in 18 months.\n- **Months 19-30:** Roll that $600 into 19.9% card ($7K). Paid off by month 30.\n- **Months 31-42:** Attack the 18.9% card ($14K). Debt-free by month 42.\n\nThat's 3.5 years, not 8. Your oldest would be 7, not 12.\n\nNow, about your wife. Here's my advice:\n\n**Don't frame this as a confession of failure. Frame it as inviting her into solving a problem together.**\n\nSomething like: 'I need to talk to you about something I've been avoiding, and I'm embarrassed about it. Our credit card debt is actually $32,000, not the $15K I mentioned before. I've been making minimum payments but it's not fixing the problem. I've been ashamed to tell you the full amount, but I talked to a financial advisor, and I have a real plan to fix this. It'll take 3.5 years at $1,200 a month. I want us to tackle this together. I'm sorry I wasn't honest sooner.'\n\nThe key is: (1) admit you avoided it, (2) take ownership, (3) show you've already done work to solve it, (4) invite her partnership.\n\nShe might be angry or hurt. That's fair—you kept something from her. But coming with a plan shows you're serious about fixing it, not just dumping a problem on her.\n\nDoes that feel like an approach you could take?",
