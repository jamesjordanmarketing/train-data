It would be $72K, so a bit more money, but the mission really resonates with me—I'd be helping improve education at scale instead of just in my classroom. My fiancée is supportive, but we're getting married in 8 months and trying to save for a house, and I'm wondering if this is the right time to make a jump. The benefits are similar—same health insurance, both have pensions. I'm excited about it, but I also don't want to be irresponsible right before a wedding. How do I think through whether this makes sense financially?",

It's actually one of the smartest things you can do for your long-term happiness and career satisfaction. Financial planning isn't just about maximizing salary; it's about building a life that aligns with your values. That said, let's make sure the financials work, which is what you're asking.\n\nHere's a framework for thinking through career changes:\n\n**1. Financial Impact:**\nYou're going from $68K to $72K—that's a $4K raise, or about $250/month extra after taxes. Benefits are similar, both have pensions. Financially, this is neutral-to-positive. You're not taking a pay cut to follow your passion, which is great.\n\n**2. Career Trajectory:**\nCurriculum development at a nonprofit could open doors to education policy, program management, or leadership roles. It's different growth than classroom teaching. Does that path interest you?\n\n**3. Timing:**\nWedding in 8 months—this is actually fine. You'd start the new job now, get settled before the wedding, and you'd have a few months of that extra $250/month to save. People change jobs around major life events all the time. It's not irresponsible unless the job itself is unstable or the pay cut would hurt your wedding/house goals. Neither applies here.\n\n**4. Values Alignment:**\nYou said 'the mission really resonates' and you'd be helping at scale. That matters for your day-to-day satisfaction. If you're excited to go to work, that's worth something that doesn't show up on a spreadsheet.\n\nYour fiancée being supportive is huge—that means you're making this decision together, which is exactly how it should work.\n\nBased on what you've shared, this looks like a good move. But tell me: what's your biggest hesitation? Is it really the money/timing, or is there something else?",

That's a legitimate tradeoff to consider.\n\nHere's how I'd assess the nonprofit's stability:\n\n**The organization:** 15 years established in education work is a good sign. Education nonprofits that focus on curriculum and school improvement tend to have more stable funding than some other nonprofit sectors because they often rely on government grants, foundation funding, and school contracts—more predictable than pure donations. If they've survived 15 years including recessions and funding shifts, they have institutional stability.\n\n**Your role:** Curriculum development is core work, not an 'extras' position. That matters—core mission roles are usually safer than support roles when budgets tighten.\n\n**Your household context:** Combined income of $120K ($72K + $52K) is solid for a couple, especially since you're both in fields with job security (teaching and social work are always needed). Your skills are transferable—if this nonprofit job ended, you could go back to teaching, move to another education org, or work in ed-tech. You're not trapped.\n\n**The stability tool:** If you want to mitigate the risk of leaving tenure, build a 6-month emergency fund. For you two, that's about $30K-$35K (covering both your basic expenses). If you already have some savings, that goal might not be far off. Having that cushion means if the nonprofit job doesn't work out, you have runway to find the right next role instead of taking the first thing available.\n\nSo yes, you're giving up tenure security. But you're not jumping into a risky startup—you're moving to an established organization in a stable sector, with transferable skills and a supportive partner. And you can build financial safety nets.\n\nDoes that help you weigh the tradeoff?",

That's strong.\n\nFor prioritization, here's what I'd recommend:\n\n**Split your savings temporarily:** Put $1,000/month toward emergency fund and $500/month toward house fund. That way, you're making progress on both goals simultaneously.\n\n**Timeline:**\n- Emergency fund: $18K now + $12K needed = $30K goal. At $1,000/month, you'd hit that in 12 months.\n- House fund: Meanwhile, you'd accumulate $6K over that year.\n- After emergency fund is done: Shift all $1,500/month to house savings.\n\n**Why this order matters for your situation:**\nYou're specifically considering leaving a tenured position for nonprofit work because you're worried about stability. Building that emergency fund *before* you make the career change gives you the safety net you're looking for. Then once it's in place, you can take the nonprofit job with confidence, knowing you have a year's runway if something unexpected happens.\n\nThe house can wait an extra year. It's better to buy a house from a position of financial stability than to stretch thin to do it faster.\n\nYou'd have your $30K emergency fund by this time next year, then you could take the nonprofit job (if the offer still stands or reapply), and then focus on house savings.

And the fact that you're talking to your fiancée tonight shows you're making this decision together, which is exactly how it should work.\n\nYou came into this worried about being 'irresponsible' by following a job that resonates with you, and you're leaving with a clear plan that honors both your values and your financial security.
