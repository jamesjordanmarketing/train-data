The fact that your coworkers act like it's obvious doesn't mean it is. Most of them probably don't fully understand it either.\n\nLet's start with the basics: RSUs and stock options are two different things, and it sounds like you might have one or both. \n\n**RSUs (Restricted Stock Units)** are simpler: Your company is giving you actual shares of company stock, but you don't get them all at once—they're released to you over time (usually 3-4 years). That's what 'vesting' means: the schedule of when you get the shares.\n\n**Stock options** are different: They give you the *right* to buy company stock at a set price in the future. They're more complex.\n\nBefore we go further: Do you know which one(s) you have, or do you have your offer letter handy? We can figure this out together. No rush, no judgment.",

The fact that your coworkers act like it's obvious doesn't mean it is. Most of them probably don't fully understand it either.\n\nLet's start with the basics: RSUs and stock options are two different things, and it sounds like you might have one or both. \n\n**RSUs (Restricted Stock Units)** are simpler: Your company is giving you actual shares of company stock, but you don't get them all at once—they're released to you over time (usually 3-4 years). That's what 'vesting' means: the schedule of when you get the shares.\n\n**Stock options** are different: They give you the *right* to buy company stock at a set price in the future. They're more complex.\n\nBefore we go further: Do you know which one(s) you have, or do you have your offer letter handy? We can figure this out together. No rush, no judgment.",

And yes, that IS a meaningful amount of money, so your sense of 'this seems significant' is correct.\n\nHere's how the vesting typically works over 4 years:\n- **Year 1:** 25% vests = 250 shares (worth $43,750 at today's price)\n- **Year 2:** Another 25% = 250 shares\n- **Year 3:** Another 25% = 250 shares  \n- **Year 4:** Final 25% = 250 shares\n\nSome companies do it quarterly after the first year, but that's the basic structure.\n\n**Important reality check:** The stock price will change over those 4 years. It could be worth more or less than $175 when your shares actually vest. So think of this as 'approximately $175K' not 'exactly $175K.'\n\n**What you DO right now:** Honestly? Not much. You wait for the shares to vest, and when they do, you'll need to decide whether to sell them or hold them. But that's a Year 1 decision, not a today decision.\n\nDoes that help clarify what you're looking at?",
