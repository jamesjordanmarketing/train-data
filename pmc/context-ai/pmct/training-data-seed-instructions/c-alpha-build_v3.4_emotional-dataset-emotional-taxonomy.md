### Intensity Calibration
- Consider context for same intensity rating
- Professional context: Lower expressed intensity
- Personal context: Fuller intensity expression
- Crisis context: Heightened intensity expected

### Temporal Dynamics
- Emotions rarely static beyond 90 seconds physiologically
- Cognitive maintenance extends duration
- Multi-turn tracking essential for progression
- Previous emotional states influence current

### Individual Variation Factors
- Personality traits (Big Five correlation)
- Attachment style influence
- Trauma history impact
- Cultural background
- Generational factors
- Neurodiversity considerations
