# Semantic Analysis: Small Business Owner Training Data Pipeline
**Purpose:** Transform the technical LoRA training process into an accessible journey for non-technical business owners

## Principles we need to understand:
The customer business owner does not KNOW or CARE what business category, methods, frameworks they are using. Trying to categorize the data by asking questions about these will not be understandable 

The questions we ask them need to be important to them the CUSTOMER. We are really trying to get them to organize their own content in their own brain into a meaningful structure for THEM.
(don't take the approach that we need to catalog the data labelling needs of the training engine and then gather that information from the customer. Instead we must help them name the parameters that are meaningful to their customer profile. Once we do that we can glean as much as we can from those answers to label ontological entities (category, method, et...). That ontological entities that are understandable, "soft" semantically, like philosophy, process, etc...

I have attempted a few different schemes to present to the user and you can see them both below. 

I need you to help me ideate, brainstorm, and upgrade this experience for the business owner customer.

A few principles:
1. Be very reductive. Meaning, think through the questions. If on answer can be inferred, or deduced from another, and/or if it if you can remove/streamline the need for a field or question 

2. The ideal situation is not "lots of questions that help us organize" the ideal situation is "as few questions as possible, and they are cognitively easy to answer."

Think in terms of mapping fields. I.e if they give X answer and from it...it the hard entity value be inferred that their "category" value maps to that answer we can populate that entity value by using a mapping scheme.  This also lets us ask questions that are understandable by them but categorizable by the engine.

3. Think like a business person, not a technical LoRA expert or a coder. For example a "true" category for a business is comprised of AT LEAST their Industry & their Service type. Both are needed.


## Executive Summary

This analysis reimagines the LoRA training data platform through the lens of a non-technical small business owner who wants to preserve and scale their unique business wisdom. The current products on the market focus heavily on technical capabilities, but miss the human-centered workflow needed for business owners who think in terms of "teaching my methods" rather than "training an AI model."

## Core Paradigm Shift

### From Technical to Human-Centered
- **Current Focus:** File formats, processing pipelines, validation algorithms
- **Needed Focus:** "Teaching my business wisdom to an AI assistant"
- **Key Insight:** Business owners don't care about JSONL formats; they care about whether the AI will represent their company values accurately

### From Facts to Wisdom
- **Current Industry Default:** Extract fact pairs from documents
- **Our Approach:** Capture opinions, philosophies, processes, and insights
- **Why It Matters:** A bakery owner's competitive advantage isn't knowing flour weighs 120g/cup (fact), but knowing to "always fold, never stir, when adding chocolate chips to preserve air pockets for that signature fluffy texture" (wisdom)

## Sarah's Journey: A Small Business Story

### Meet Sarah - The Boutique Marketing Consultant

Sarah runs a successful boutique marketing agency specializing in authentic brand storytelling for local businesses. After 15 years, she's developed unique methodologies that consistently deliver results. She wants to create an AI assistant that can help her team apply her methods consistently, but she's not technical - she thinks in stories, strategies, and client relationships.

## Stage 1: Project Creation - "Starting My Teaching Journey"

### What Sarah Sees:
**Welcome Screen:** "Let's Structure Your Wisdom"
- Not: "Create New LoRA Training Project"
- But: "Start Teaching Your Private AI Model"

### The Conversation:

## Stage 1: Document Upload - "Sharing My Knowledge"

### What Sarah Sees:
**Individual Document Interface:** "Review This Document: [Name of Document]"

When Sarah selects a document it takes her to a step by step process that 
guides her to:

1. Statement of Belonging
The first question is: "How close is this document to describing your own special voice and skill"


1. This Document's Cognitive Relationship to our BRAND


a. This document is written by me and contains my entire special system which produces the special value of my product/service

b. This document is written by me and contains the majority of one of my special systems with the special value of my product/service

c. This document was written by me and contains portions of my special knowledge and value but not an entire system

d. This document contains one or more of my proprietary strategies

e. This document contains a unique story that illustrates the unique benefits of my product/service

f. This document is written by me and contains step by step instructions to benefitting from my product/services.



b. This document was written by me but primarily contains marketing content that describes my special benefits without divulging my special value

This document contains a conversation with BRAND and one of our customers. It highlights our special value
This document contains a conversation with BRAND and one of our customers. It describes ways in which we solved the customers' problem
This document contains a conversation with BRAND and one of our customers. It contains feedback from the customer about the benefits of our product/services


z. This document was not written by me and does NOT contain any of my special wisdom



mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
Idea
Ask for their business category. Then ask that each document be tagged with how specific it is to their business category
mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm

1. Categorize this document with our special categories:
   - Lesson
   - Process
   - Philosophy
   - Marketing Content
   - Wisdom
   - Special Sauce
   - Case Studies & Examples
   - Stories
   - Brand
   - Add Custom Categories

After the document is categorized (can choose more than one), the document is submitted to our proprietary AI prompt that uses the category tags to analyze the document and extract 5 of each of the following from the document:

 - Concepts
 - Branded Chunks
 - A Process
 - A Step in a process
 - My Special Beliefs / Wisdom
 - Example Case Study
 - Etc...

After the chunks are labelled 

- 

2. üí° **Your Insights & Philosophy**
   - "What you've learned over the years"
   - "Your business principles"
   - "Why you do things differently"

3. üìù **Your Instructions & Examples**
   - "Email templates you use"
   - "Client communication examples"
   - "Case studies and success stories"

### Sarah's Action:
She drags in:
- Her "Brand Story Framework" PDF
- Five years of successful client proposals
- Her training manual for new team members
- Email templates showing her communication style

### The System's Response:
```
Wherever possible, instead of saying anything like 
we need to be able to include detailed prompts that will elict these type of details


"Great! I'm reading through your documents to understand:
‚úì Your Brand Story Framework (Found your 5-step process!)
‚úì Your proposal approach (Noticed you always start with 'why')
‚úì Your training methods (Love your emphasis on authenticity)
‚úì Your communication style (Professional yet warm - got it!)

Everything looks good! Ready for the next step?"
```

**Behind the Scenes:** The system performs all validation, format checking, and content extraction, but presents results in business terms.

## Stage 3: AI Understanding Check - "Did I Get This Right?"

### What Sarah Sees:
**The Interpretation Dashboard:** "Here's What I Learned From Each Document"

For each document, the system shows:

**Document: "Brand Story Framework.pdf"**
```
What I understood:
"You believe every small business has a unique story that connects
with their ideal customers. Your 5-step framework helps uncover
and articulate this story through customer interviews, value
identification, and authentic messaging."

Key Concepts I Found:
‚Ä¢ The "Story-First" approach to branding
‚Ä¢ Your "Customer Voice Mining" technique
‚Ä¢ The "Authenticity Over Perfection" principle
‚Ä¢ Your "Local Connection" strategy

Does this capture your approach correctly?
[Yes, Perfect!] [Needs Adjustment] [Add Context]
```

UI Interface Breakdown Brainstorm #2

Use these categories and enhance them (not by adding more sub atomic answers to this one, but by thinking along this semantic plane adding new sections when they will be exciting to the business owner to work on and organize their minds)
Love this idea‚Äîlet‚Äôs turn your list into a practical taxonomy you can actually sort, tag, and make decisions with. Here‚Äôs a tighter hierarchy, plus scoring, tags, and a quick decision tree so anyone on your team can classify a doc in under a minute.

# Conclusion

Remember this exercise is about REDUCING the amount of questions, friction, and cognitive load required by the business owner. It is more important that they can organize first for themselves. And actually LoRA data quality and granularity is less important than an amazing experience by the customer business owner.

Ok please use this specification to help me brainstorm approach so this problem. We are solving a problem that does not have a good answer yet for humanity and it is one reason it is valuable. Stretch yourself and lets produce something as novel as it is effective.
