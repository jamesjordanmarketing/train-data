## 4. Prompt Input Optimization: Reducing Context and Focusing on Acceptance Criteria

### Current Prompt Inefficiencies Identified:

**Unnecessary Context Sections (Can be Removed/Simplified):**
1. **Journey Scope and Boundaries** (Lines 42-46 in original spec)
   - *Rationale:* This is already defined in the source user journey specs
   - *Recommendation:* Remove entirely, reference source documents

2. **Success Definition** (Lines 47-50 in original spec)
   - *Rationale:* Redundant with stage-specific success criteria
   - *Recommendation:* Replace with brief reference to stage completion criteria

3. **Value Progression Story for Proof-of-Concept** (Lines 51-55 in original spec)
   - *Rationale:* Strategic context not needed for detailed acceptance criteria generation
   - *Recommendation:* Remove entirely

4. **User Persona Definitions** (Lines 101-253 in original spec)
   - *Rationale:* Should reference existing comprehensive personas rather than recreate
   - *Recommendation:* Replace with "Use personas from [reference] with Stage 2 focus"

### **Optimized Prompt Structure:**

```markdown

   - **Analysis:** User stories specify exact formats, GWT provides user experience

2. **Technical Implementation Specifics:**
   - User Stories: "File validation and error handling with helpful guidance"
   - GWT: "Failed uploads provide clear guidance on how to fix issues"
   - **Analysis:** User stories specify validation requirement, GWT specifies user experience

3. **Feature Completeness:**
   - User Stories: "Document preview and metadata display after successful upload"
   - GWT: "The system shows me what will be used for training"
   - **Analysis:** User stories specify metadata display, GWT focuses on training relevance

### **RECOMMENDATION: Hybrid Approach**

**Maintain GWT Format for User Experience + Add Technical Acceptance Criteria**

```markdown
* User Journey Acceptance Criteria (Experience Focus):
  - GIVEN: I have knowledge in various formats
  - WHEN: I want to upload my content
  - THEN: I can simply drag and drop files
  - AND: I see immediate visual feedback

* Technical Acceptance Criteria (Implementation Focus):
  - System supports PDF, DOCX, TXT, HTML, transcript formats
  - File validation occurs before processing initiation
  - Metadata extraction includes title, date, format, size
  - Error messages specify format requirements and alternatives
  - Progress tracking granularity: file-level and batch-level
```

**Benefits of Hybrid Approach:**
1. **Comprehensive Coverage:** Captures both user experience and technical requirements
2. **Functional Requirements Ready:** Both user and technical criteria support FR development
3. **QA Testable:** Both user acceptance and technical validation can be tested

## Conclusion

The analysis reveals that Version C provides the strongest foundation for functional requirements generation, with strategic enhancements from Versions B and D creating an optimal hybrid approach. The current Given/When/Then format effectively captures user experience requirements but should be supplemented with technical acceptance criteria to provide comprehensive functional requirements foundation.

The recommended approach creates a robust, detailed user journey document that serves both user experience validation and technical implementation guidance, directly supporting the creation of comprehensive functional requirements for Stage 2 implementation.

**Confidence in Approach:** High (85%+) - The enhanced hybrid version will provide excellent foundation for functional requirements while maintaining user-centric focus and technical implementation clarity.
