## Detailed Update Requirements

### 1. Environment Variables and Configuration Setup

#### 1.1 Environment File Management
The script must create and manage environment variable files for LLM Vision API configuration. Add functionality to check for existing environment files and create template files with proper instructions.

The script needs to detect if a `.env` file exists in the project root. If it does not exist, create a new `.env` file with template entries for all required environment variables. If it does exist, validate that required variables are present and add missing ones with placeholder values.

For the LLM Vision system, the script must include entries for `CLAUDE_API_KEY` with example format showing the `sk-ant-` prefix requirement, `CLAUDE_MODEL` with default value of `claude-3-7-sonnet-20241022`, and optional performance tuning variables like `VISION_MAX_TOKENS`, `VISION_TEMPERATURE`, `VISION_ANALYSIS_TIMEOUT`, `VISION_MAX_RETRIES`, `VISION_CACHE_ENABLED`, `VISION_BATCH_SIZE`, `VISION_RATE_LIMIT_DELAY`, and `VISION_VERBOSE`.

The script should create an additional `vision-config.env.example` file in the project root that contains detailed comments explaining each environment variable's purpose, acceptable values, and impact on system performance.

#### 1.2 Environment Validation Integration
Add environment validation capabilities by integrating with the existing `test/utils/vision/vision-config.js` module. The installation script must call the `validateEnvironment()` function from the vision config module during installation to verify that all required environment variables are properly configured.

If environment validation fails, the script must provide clear, actionable error messages explaining exactly what needs to be configured and how to obtain the required API keys. Include links to Claude API documentation for obtaining API keys.

For warnings about optional configuration, the script should explain the impact of using default values versus custom configuration, particularly for performance optimization settings.

### 2. Enhanced Directory Structure Creation

#### 2.1 LLM Vision Infrastructure Directories
The current directory creation logic must be expanded to include all directories required by the LLM Vision system. Add creation of `test/utils/vision` directory for LLM Vision modules, `test/vision-results` for analysis output files, `test/vision-cache` for caching LLM responses to improve performance, and `test/vision-logs` for detailed API interaction logging.

#### 2.2 Enhanced Scaffolding Directories
Add directory creation for the enhanced scaffolding system including `test/utils/scaffold-templates` for React SSR scaffolding modules, `test/scaffolds` with subdirectories for each task ID (like `test/scaffolds/T-1.1.3`), `test/utils/visual-regression` for comparison engine and reference management, and `test/references` with subdirectories for reference screenshots.

#### 2.3 Component Registry and Testing Infrastructure
Create directories for component management including `test/utils/component-registry` for component metadata storage, `test/component-tests` for enhanced component-specific tests, `test/visual-tests` for visual testing workflows, and `test/autonomous-tests` for autonomous testing cycle implementations.

#### 2.4 Enhanced Reporting and Dashboard Infrastructure
Add directories for comprehensive reporting including `test/reports` with subdirectories for different report types (`visual-regression`, `llm-analysis`, `confidence-metrics`, `coverage-reports`), `test/diffs` for visual regression difference images, and `test/utils/server-manager/dashboard` for dashboard components and assets.

### 3. Dependency Management Updates

#### 3.1 LLM Vision Dependencies
The dependency installation section must be updated to include all packages required for LLM Vision functionality. Add `axios` for API requests to Claude Vision API, `dotenv` for environment variable management, and `sharp` for advanced image processing capabilities beyond basic file operations.

Update the version specifications to use current stable versions that are compatible with the LLM Vision implementation. Ensure `axios` is at version `^1.6.0` or higher for proper promise handling in the vision analyzer.

#### 3.2 Enhanced Testing Dependencies
Add dependencies for the enhanced testing capabilities including `minimist` for command-line argument parsing in test runners, `chalk` for colored console output in logging systems, `ts-node` for TypeScript support in component importing, and `typescript` for type checking in the component registry.

For visual regression testing, ensure `playwright` is updated to version `^1.40.0` or higher to support the enhanced screenshot capture system with proper boundary injection.

#### 3.3 React SSR Dependencies
The React SSR scaffolding system requires additional dependencies. Add `react-dom/server` for server-side rendering capabilities, `@babel/core` and `@babel/preset-react` for component compilation, and ensure `react` and `react-dom` are at version `^18.2.0` for compatibility with the enhanced scaffolding system.

#### 3.4 Image Processing Dependencies
For the image processing pipeline used by LLM Vision, add `sharp` for high-performance image manipulation, `jimp` as a fallback for environments where Sharp is not available, and ensure proper handling of image format conversion and base64 encoding.

### 4. Package.json Script Management

#### 4.1 LLM Vision Scripts
Add new npm scripts for LLM Vision operations. Include `test:vision:verify-api` that calls the vision config validation to check API connectivity, `test:vision:analyze` that runs LLM Vision analysis on specified task screenshots, `test:vision:validate` that performs component validation with confidence thresholds, `test:vision:confidence` that generates confidence reports, and `test:vision:report` that creates detailed LLM Vision analysis reports.

#### 4.2 Enhanced Testing Pipeline Scripts
Update the testing pipeline scripts to support the new autonomous testing capabilities. Add `test:server:enhanced` that starts the enhanced test server with React SSR support, `test:dashboard:enhanced` that starts the enhanced dashboard with LLM Vision integration, `test:visual:enhanced` that runs the enhanced visual testing pipeline, `scaffold:enhanced` that creates enhanced scaffolds with real React rendering, and `test:autonomous` that runs the complete autonomous testing cycle with retry logic.

#### 4.3 Component Management Scripts
Add scripts for component registry operations including `component:discover` that runs component discovery and registration, `component:validate` that validates component imports and metadata, `component:registry:reset` that clears and rebuilds the component registry, and `component:summary` that generates component registry summary reports.

#### 4.4 Visual Regression Scripts
Include scripts for visual regression testing including `test:visual:update` that updates reference screenshots, `test:visual:compare` that runs comparison against references, `test:visual:report` that generates visual regression reports, and `test:references:clean` that cleans old reference screenshots.

### 5. Configuration File Generation

#### 5.1 Enhanced Jest Configuration
The Jest configuration must be updated to support the enhanced testing system. Add test environment setup for component registry initialization, module name mapping for the new testing utilities including vision modules and scaffold templates, and transform patterns for TypeScript components with proper babel configuration.

Include setup files for LLM Vision testing environment, component registry initialization, and mock configurations for testing utilities. Add coverage collection patterns that include the new testing infrastructure while excluding test files themselves.

#### 5.2 Enhanced Playwright Configuration
Update the Playwright configuration to integrate with the enhanced server system. Modify the web server configuration to use the enhanced test server, update the base URL to match the enhanced server port configuration, and add project-specific settings for testing server and client components separately.

Include custom test directories for visual testing and component testing, with proper output directory configuration for screenshots and reports. Add retry logic configuration to match the autonomous testing system requirements.

#### 5.3 TypeScript Configuration for Testing
Create a specialized TypeScript configuration for the testing system that includes path mapping for testing utilities, module resolution for component imports, and compilation settings optimized for the React SSR scaffolding system.

The configuration must support both ESM and CommonJS module formats to accommodate different testing utilities and ensure proper type checking for component metadata extraction.

### 6. Component Registry Initialization

#### 6.1 Component Registry Setup
The installation script must initialize the component registry system during setup. This involves creating the component registry database file, running initial component discovery to populate the registry with existing components, and validating that all discovered components can be properly imported and analyzed.

The script should call the `ComponentRegistry.discoverAndRegisterComponents()` method with force rediscovery enabled to ensure a clean slate. Handle any component import failures gracefully and provide detailed logging about which components were successfully registered versus which failed and why.

#### 6.2 Component Metadata Extraction
Initialize the component metadata extraction system by running the component importer on all discovered components. This includes extracting component types (server versus client), identifying dependencies and browser API usage, extracting prop interfaces and default values, and determining component composition relationships.

The script must validate that the metadata extraction process works correctly for all component types and provide detailed reporting on any components that cannot be properly analyzed.

### 7. LLM Vision System Initialization

#### 7.1 Vision Configuration Validation
During installation, the script must validate the LLM Vision configuration by calling the validation functions from the vision config module. This includes checking environment variable setup, validating API key format, testing basic API connectivity if an API key is provided, and verifying image processing capabilities.

The script should provide clear feedback on the validation results and guide users through resolving any configuration issues. If no API key is provided during installation, the script should explain how to configure it later and what functionality will be unavailable until configuration is complete.

#### 7.2 Vision System Verification
After LLM Vision dependencies are installed, run the vision system verification tests to ensure the implementation is working correctly. This includes testing image processing functions, validating component validator rule loading, checking model configuration settings, and verifying cache directory setup.

Create a summary report of the vision system capabilities and any limitations based on the current configuration.

### 8. Enhanced Server Infrastructure Setup

#### 8.1 Enhanced Server Configuration
The installation script must set up the enhanced server infrastructure by configuring the React SSR server with proper port settings, setting up the dashboard server with LLM Vision integration, creating server startup scripts with proper error handling, and configuring server monitoring and health check endpoints.

The script should validate that the server configuration is compatible with the existing project structure and that all required server dependencies are available.

#### 8.2 Dashboard Integration Setup
Initialize the dashboard system with LLM Vision integration including setting up dashboard component templates, configuring LLM Vision result display, creating navigation and reporting interfaces, and integrating with the visual regression testing system.

The script must ensure that the dashboard can properly communicate with the LLM Vision API and display analysis results in a human-readable format.

### 9. Testing Pipeline Integration

#### 9.1 Autonomous Testing Setup
Configure the autonomous testing pipeline by setting up retry logic configuration, creating test execution workflows, configuring fix/test/analyze cycle parameters, and establishing success criteria and quality gates.

The script must initialize the testing pipeline with proper logging and monitoring capabilities to track the autonomous testing cycles and provide detailed reporting on test results and any required manual interventions.

#### 9.2 Visual Testing Pipeline Integration
Integrate the visual testing pipeline with the enhanced capabilities including screenshot capture with boundary injection, visual regression comparison with reference management, LLM Vision analysis integration, and comprehensive reporting with confidence metrics.

The script should validate that all components of the visual testing pipeline work together correctly and provide sample test runs to verify functionality.

### 10. Validation and Verification

#### 10.1 Installation Verification
After all components are installed, the script must run comprehensive verification tests including component registry functionality, LLM Vision system connectivity, enhanced scaffolding capabilities, visual testing pipeline, server infrastructure, and dashboard integration.

Create detailed verification reports that show the status of each system component and provide specific guidance for resolving any issues found during verification.

#### 10.2 System Integration Testing
Run integration tests to verify that all systems work together correctly including component discovery through LLM Vision analysis workflows, scaffolding generation through screenshot capture, visual regression testing through LLM Vision validation, and autonomous testing cycle execution.

The script should provide clear success/failure indicators for each integration test and detailed troubleshooting guidance for any failures.

### 11. Error Handling and Recovery

#### 11.1 Robust Error Handling
Implement comprehensive error handling throughout the installation process including graceful handling of network failures during dependency installation, clear error messages for configuration issues, automatic retry logic for transient failures, and detailed logging of all installation steps for troubleshooting.

The script must be able to recover from partial installation failures and resume from the last successful step rather than starting over completely.

#### 11.2 Rollback Capabilities
Implement rollback capabilities for failed installations including restoration of original package.json if dependency installation fails, cleanup of partially created directory structures, restoration of original configuration files, and clear documentation of what changes were made versus what was rolled back.

### 12. Documentation and Reporting

#### 12.1 Installation Documentation
Generate comprehensive installation documentation including detailed system configuration summary, environment variable requirements and setup instructions, testing pipeline usage guide, LLM Vision system configuration and usage, component registry management, and troubleshooting guide for common issues.

#### 12.2 System Status Reporting
Create detailed system status reports showing installed components and their versions, configuration status for all systems, verification test results, performance benchmarks where applicable, and recommendations for optimization or additional configuration.

The reports should be saved in machine-readable format for integration with monitoring systems and human-readable format for manual review.
