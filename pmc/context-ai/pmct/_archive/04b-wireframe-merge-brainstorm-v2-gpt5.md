# Wireframe Analysis and Feature Comparison Report

## 1. Which Wireframe Best Represents FR1 Acceptance Criteria?

**Winner: FR-1.1-Brun-upload-page (Wireframe A)**

Wireframe A better represents the functionality required to meet the FR1 acceptance criteria for the following reasons:

### Comprehensive Document Processing Features:
- **Multi-format support**: Implements drag-and-drop with support for PDF, DOC, DOCX, PPT, PPTX, TXT, MD, CSV, and JSON
- **Advanced processing pipeline**: Features a complete 4-stage workflow (Upload → Validation → Preview → Summary)
- **Real-time progress tracking**: Visual progress indicators with detailed status updates
- **Error handling and remediation**: Dedicated remediation modal for handling corrupted files
- **Content preview**: Full content preview with metadata preservation
- **Batch processing**: Queue management system for multiple file uploads
- **Processing logs**: Comprehensive logging system for extraction operations

### FR1 Acceptance Criteria Alignment:
✅ **Document format support**: Complete implementation with automatic format detection  
✅ **99%+ accuracy**: Advanced OCR and text parsing algorithms referenced  
✅ **Metadata preservation**: Comprehensive metadata tracking in store  
✅ **Error handling**: Specific error messages with remediation workflows  
✅ **Visual progress indicators**: Real-time upload and processing status  
✅ **Batch processing**: Queue management with progress tracking  
✅ **Large file handling**: Streaming processing up to 100MB  
✅ **Drag-and-drop interface**: Intuitive file upload experience  
✅ **Processing logs**: Detailed extraction operation records  

Wireframe B, while functional, focuses more on analysis configuration and lacks the comprehensive document processing pipeline required by FR1.

## 3. Recommended MVP Development Approaches

### Approach 1: Frontend-First Rapid Prototyping

**Strategy**: Build on Wireframe A foundation with incremental backend integration

**Phase 1 (Week 1-2): Enhanced Frontend**
- Extend Wireframe A with missing UI components
- Add export format selection interface
- Implement training pipeline configuration screens
- Create mock API responses for rapid iteration

**Phase 2 (Week 3-4): Core Backend Integration**
- Implement T-1.1.0 Document Processing with real file handling
- Add T-1.2.0 Export Format Generation
- Create basic T-1.3.0 Training Pipeline Integration

**Phase 3 (Week 5-6): Advanced Features**
- Real-time progress tracking with WebSockets
- Advanced error handling and remediation
- Training job monitoring and notifications

**Advantages:**
- Fast user feedback and validation
- Visual progress motivates stakeholders
- Early identification of UX issues
- Parallel frontend/backend development

**Timeline**: 6 weeks to functional MVP
**Risk**: Potential rework if backend constraints affect UI

### Approach 2: API-First Microservices Architecture

**Strategy**: Build robust backend services first, then connect optimized frontend

**Phase 1 (Week 1-3): Core Services**
- Document Processing Service (T-1.1.0) with full acceptance criteria
- Export Format Service (T-1.2.0) with all supported formats
- Training Integration Service (T-1.3.0) with cloud provider APIs

**Phase 2 (Week 4-5): API Gateway and Orchestration**
- Workflow orchestration engine
- Real-time status updates via WebSockets
- Job queue management with Redis/RabbitMQ

**Phase 3 (Week 6-7): Frontend Integration**
- Streamlined UI based on proven API capabilities
- Real-time updates and progress tracking
- Advanced configuration and monitoring interfaces

**Advantages:**
- Scalable, production-ready architecture
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easier testing and maintenance
- Better performance and reliability

**Timeline**: 7 weeks to production-ready MVP
**Risk**: Longer time to visible progress

### Recommended Hybrid Approach: "Progressive Enhancement"

**Best of Both Worlds Strategy:**

**Week 1**: Start with Wireframe A as foundation, implement T-1.1.0 with simplified backend
**Week 2**: Add T-1.2.0 export functionality with basic formats (JSON, CSV)
**Week 3**: Implement T-1.3.0 with one training provider (HuggingFace)
**Week 4**: Enhance UI with real-time updates and advanced error handling
**Week 5**: Add remaining export formats and training providers
**Week 6**: Polish UX, add configuration management, and comprehensive testing

**Key Success Factors:**
1. **Start with Wireframe A** as the foundation - it's closest to FR1 requirements
2. **Implement backend tasks incrementally** - T-1.1.0 → T-1.2.0 → T-1.3.0
3. **Use WebSockets early** for real-time progress updates
4. **Mock complex integrations initially** (RunPod, Vast.ai) and implement progressively
5. **Focus on the complete user journey** from upload to training initiation

**Timeline**: 6 weeks to feature-complete MVP
**Risk**: Balanced - manageable complexity with steady progress

This hybrid approach provides the fastest path to a working MVP while building toward a scalable, production-ready system that fully satisfies the FR1 acceptance criteria.
