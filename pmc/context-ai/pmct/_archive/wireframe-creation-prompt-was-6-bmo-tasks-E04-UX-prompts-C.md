  - Design Prompt: "Create a download management interface showing export history, file status (preparing, ready, expired), download links, and file management options. Include progress tracking for large exports, retry options for failed exports, and bulk download capabilities. Add file organization and sharing features."
  - Input/Output/View: Export history, file status, download progress → File management, download controls, status tracking → Table-based layout with status indicators and action buttons

**Implementation Process:**
1. Preparation Phase:
   - [PREP-1] Design export format selection and configuration interface (implements ELE-1)
   - [PREP-2] Plan professional reporting system with template management (implements ELE-2)
   - [PREP-3] Create download management dashboard and file tracking system (implements ELE-3)
2. Implementation Phase:
   - [IMP-1] Build export format selector with customization options (implements ELE-1)
   - [IMP-2] Implement professional reporting system with template customization (implements ELE-2)
   - [IMP-3] Create download management dashboard with progress tracking (implements ELE-3)
   - [IMP-4] Add export validation and error handling (implements ELE-1, ELE-3)
3. Validation Phase:
   - [VAL-1] Test export format selection and customization options (validates ELE-1)
   - [VAL-2] Verify professional reporting system and template customization (validates ELE-2)
   - [VAL-3] Test download management and file tracking functionality (validates ELE-3)

## Mobile-Responsive Design Considerations

### Responsive Design Requirements
- **Breakpoints:** Mobile (320-768px), Tablet (768-1024px), Desktop (1024px+)
- **Navigation:** Collapsible sidebar navigation with hamburger menu for mobile
- **Touch Interactions:** Minimum 44px touch targets, swipe gestures for navigation
- **Content Adaptation:** Stacked layouts for mobile, progressive disclosure for complex interfaces
- **Performance:** Optimized images, lazy loading, reduced animations on mobile

### Mobile-Specific UX Patterns
- **Workflow Navigation:** Vertical step indicator for mobile, horizontal for desktop
- **Data Input:** Full-screen modal for text input, simplified file upload interface
- **Results Viewing:** Card-based layout with swipe navigation, collapsible details
- **Configuration:** Accordion-style panels, simplified parameter controls
- **Export:** Streamlined export options, mobile-optimized download management

## Accessibility Design Requirements

### WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance
- **Color Contrast:** Minimum 4.5:1 ratio for normal text, 3:1 for large text
- **Keyboard Navigation:** Full keyboard accessibility with visible focus indicators
- **Screen Reader Support:** Proper ARIA labels, semantic HTML structure
- **Alternative Text:** Descriptive alt text for all images and icons
- **Form Accessibility:** Clear labels, error messages, and validation feedback

### Inclusive Design Features
- **High Contrast Mode:** Alternative color schemes for visual impairments
- **Font Size Controls:** User-adjustable text sizing options
- **Motion Preferences:** Respect for reduced motion preferences
- **Language Support:** Internationalization ready with RTL support
- **Cognitive Accessibility:** Clear navigation, consistent patterns, helpful error messages

## Implementation Summary

### Total Estimated Hours: 45-55 hours
- **T-4.1.0 Pipeline Workflow Interface:** 14-18 hours
- **T-4.2.0 Data Input and Configuration:** 14-18 hours  
- **T-4.3.0 Results Visualization and Export:** 16-20 hours
- **Mobile and Accessibility Implementation:** 3-5 hours

### Key Dependencies
- **Backend APIs:** Real-time progress tracking, data processing status
- **Design System:** Consistent component library and styling framework
- **State Management:** Global state for workflow progress and user preferences
- **File Handling:** Secure file upload and processing capabilities
- **Export Services:** Background job processing for large exports

### Critical Path Items
1. **Workflow Progress Visualization** (T-4.1.1:ELE-1) - Foundation for all workflow interactions
2. **File Upload Interface** (T-4.2.1:ELE-1) - Essential for data input functionality
3. **Quality Metrics Dashboard** (T-4.3.1:ELE-1) - Core results visualization component
4. **Export System** (T-4.3.3:ELE-1) - Critical for data output and user value delivery

### Success Metrics for UX Design
- **Task Completion Rate:** >95% successful workflow completions
- **User Satisfaction:** >4.5/5 average rating for interface usability
- **Error Rate:** <2% user errors requiring support intervention
- **Mobile Usage:** >80% feature parity between desktop and mobile interfaces
- **Accessibility Compliance:** 100% WCAG 2.1 AA compliance verification
- **Performance:** <3 second load times for all interface components
