Yes we need to execute this and it is very large and needs to be done in segments.

Here is what you are going to do now:

1. You are going to write a better executive summary for this context. This needs to be a very brief background on the module (as the north star) and the stage in the build we are in.  And then a specific directive to the next agent as to what their job is with all of the instructions below.

2. You are going to segment this giant instruction into 3 different prompt files. You will write one file per prompt.  The output files will be (as noted below):
- `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\train-data\pmc\context-ai\pmct\build-bugs-execute-prompt-E01_v1.md`
- `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\train-data\pmc\context-ai\pmct\build-bugs-execute-prompt-E02_v1.md`
- `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\train-data\pmc\context-ai\pmct\build-bugs-execute-prompt-E03_v1.md`

3. Deliver a new version which is directive in tone. Also: 

4. Include the prompt(s) that I will submit to the Claude-4.5-sonnet Thinking LLM to execute the product build and coding changes. I must be able to cut and paste these prompts into a 200k Claude-4.5-sonnet Thinking context window in Cursor.

5. Make sure as you write the specification you don't leave any important context, direction, or instruction, outside of the prompts. Because the building agent will only see the information that is in the prompt(s)
Organize the successive prompts so that each one can be executed in a new 200k token context window

5. If more than one prompt(s) are needed to use the Claude-4.5-sonnet Thinking LLM to execute the product build and coding changes, I must be able to cut and paste these prompts into a 200k Claude-4.5-sonnet Thinking context window in Cursor. They should be modular, so that the subsequent prompt does not need to finish the prior component.

6. Do NOT include the same code/query/details outside the prompt sections if they same information is in the prompts. It gets confusing as to which blocks I am to copy and paste.

7. Make very clear what sections I must cut and paste (sql or prompt). At the beginning of what I must cut put a row of ======================== plus 3 new lines after the ====== line. At the end of what I must cut put a row of +++++++++++++++++ plus 3 new lines after the +++++++ line.

8. You must read: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\train-data\pmc\product\_mapping\fr-maps\04-FR-wireframes-execution-E05.md`. It is a good example of the format that you can utilize.

Put the new files here: 
- `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\train-data\pmc\context-ai\pmct\build-bugs-execute-prompt-E01_v1.md`
- `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\train-data\pmc\context-ai\pmct\build-bugs-execute-prompt-E02_v1.md`
- `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\train-data\pmc\context-ai\pmct\build-bugs-execute-prompt-E03_v1.md`
