FIRST we need to architect and complete the full version of the FINAL JSON and JSONL formats that will be ACTUAL LoRA Training Files.  
We have the current "Enriched JSON" which captures one conversation EXAMPLE. This is based on our current schema which is here: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\train-data\pmc\context-ai\pmct\training-data-seeds\c-alpha-build_v3.4_emotional-dataset-JSON-format_v3.json`. PLEASE NOTE that this format schema is OUT OF DATE. The most recent example ENRICHED are the most up to date version. 

So the first thing we need to do is update the `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\train-data\pmc\context-ai\pmct\training-data-seeds\c-alpha-build_v3.4_emotional-dataset-JSON-format_v3.json` schema format to include the new very important scaffolding, parameters, metadata. You can see the details of the implementation here: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\train-data\pmc\context-ai\pmct\iteration-2-json-updated_v1.md`


You can write the new version of the schema to: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\train-data\pmc\context-ai\pmct\training-data-seeds\c-alpha-build_v3.4_emotional-dataset-JSON-format_v4.json`

We also need to build on top of the new `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\train-data\pmc\context-ai\pmct\training-data-seeds\c-alpha-build_v3.4_emotional-dataset-JSON-format_v4.json` to build two new schemas:

1. LoRA Training Full Training File Format.
I will ask you, as the senior LoRA XML file architect to build new complete schema for:

a. The full training file that can contain thousands of collected conversations.
b. The full training file that can contain thousands of collected conversations, in a JSONL format

Keep in mind that:
1. These full files will be used for LoRA training.
2. These full files will have each of the "Enriched JSON" files (EXAMPLES) added to the full training files.
3. I want these production full files to be designed to be among the most effective LoRA training formats in the industry. Do not fill it with more information than we already have (see examples) but design the XML to be very effective at training models.


So your job in this prompt is to:
1. Add the new categories and elements to the existing individual conversation JSON schema. Put the new schema here: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\train-data\pmc\context-ai\pmct\training-data-seeds\c-alpha-build_v3.4_emotional-dataset-individual-JSON-format_v4.json`

2. Create the two new "Full" schemas that have the new updates and also have been upgraded to be among the most effective LoRA training formats in the industry. Do not add elements or categories we don't already have. Put those new format schemas here:
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\train-data\pmc\context-ai\pmct\training-data-seeds\c-alpha-build_v3.4_emotional-dataset-full-JSON-format_v4.json`
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\train-data\pmc\context-ai\pmct\training-data-seeds\c-alpha-build_v3.4_emotional-dataset-full-JSON-format_v4.jsonl`

3. Create an example full file as proof that the "full" schema format is accurate, precise, and capable of mapping multiple conversations in one file. 
Put the example new full file here: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\train-data\pmc\context-ai\pmct\training-data-seeds\c-alpha-build_v3.4_emotional-dataset-JSON-example_v4.json`



concatenate the files into one big file.

I should be able to:

1. Sort and filter the conversations on the \conversations\ page by batch job. Then I must be able to "select all".
2. I must also be able to select ANY 
2. Then I must be able to "combine all"
3. The output must be two files:

Design it.

1. New column on conversations Batch ID. 
2. We can sort and filter on the Batch ID field.
3. New page called LoRA Training JSON Files
4. This page will be empty to begin with.
5. On the conversations page there will be a "create training files" button. This button has the purpose of concatenating all the files that have been checked in the table. 
6. Clicking on the create training files button will pop up a dropdown that shows all of the current full production JSON files (it does not show the JSONL files). Selecting one of the full JSON files will then add all the files that have been checked on the conversations table to that specific JSON file. 
7. The JSONL file is ALWAYS generated alongside the JSON file. I think the easiest would be to just automatically convert the full JSON file to a JSONL file, correct?
8. On the new LoRA Training JSON Files page if you select a generated JSON file a drop down will allow you to choose to download either the JSON file or the JSONL file.


to think about 
Do we need to concatendate each new file within the XML header/footer nodes or can they simply be concatentated to the end of an existing file
