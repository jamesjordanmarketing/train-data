It takes about 5 minutes. Your paycheck will be slightly smaller (about $260 less per month after taxes), but you'll be building real wealth.\n\nFor the fund choices, here's the simplest answer for most people your age: Look for the \"Target Date 2050\" or \"Target Date 2055\" fund. These are designed for people retiring around that year. They automatically adjust to become more conservative as you age, so you don't have to think about it.\n\nThat's it. One fund. No complexity. You can always optimize later once you feel more comfortable.\n\nWould you like me to walk you through what to look for when you log in?",
