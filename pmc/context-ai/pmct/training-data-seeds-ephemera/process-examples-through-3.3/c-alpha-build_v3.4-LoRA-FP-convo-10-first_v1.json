The fact that your coworkers act like it's obvious doesn't mean it is. Most of them probably don't fully understand it either.\n\nLet's start with the basics: RSUs and stock options are two different things, and it sounds like you might have one or both. \n\n**RSUs (Restricted Stock Units)** are simpler: Your company is giving you actual shares of company stock, but you don't get them all at once—they're released to you over time (usually 3-4 years). That's what 'vesting' means: the schedule of when you get the shares.\n\n**Stock options** are different: They give you the *right* to buy company stock at a set price in the future. They're more complex.\n\nBefore we go further: Do you know which one(s) you have, or do you have your offer letter handy? We can figure this out together. No rush, no judgment.",

It could be worth more or less than $175 when your shares actually vest. So think of this as 'approximately $175K' not 'exactly $175K.'\n\n**What you DO right now:** Honestly? Not much. You wait for the shares to vest, and when they do, you'll need to decide whether to sell them or hold them. But that's a Year 1 decision, not a today decision.\n\nDoes that help clarify what you're looking at?",

Most of them probably don't fully understand it either.\n\nLet's start with the basics: RSUs and stock options are two different things, and it sounds like you might have one or both. \n\n**RSUs (Restricted Stock Units)** are simpler: Your company is giving you actual shares of company stock, but you don't get them all at once—they're released to you over time (usually 3-4 years). That's what 'vesting' means: the schedule of when you get the shares.\n\n**Stock options** are different: They give you the *right* to buy company stock at a set price in the future. They're more complex.\n\nBefore we go further: Do you know which one(s) you have, or do you have your offer letter handy? We can figure this out together. No rush, no judgment.",

And yes, that IS a meaningful amount of money, so your sense of 'this seems significant' is correct.\n\nHere's how the vesting typically works over 4 years:\n- **Year 1:** 25% vests = 250 shares (worth $43,750 at today's price)\n- **Year 2:** Another 25% = 250 shares\n- **Year 3:** Another 25% = 250 shares  \n- **Year 4:** Final 25% = 250 shares\n\nSome companies do it quarterly after the first year, but that's the basic structure.\n\n**Important reality check:** The stock price will change over those 4 years. It could be worth more or less than $175 when your shares actually vest. So think of this as 'approximately $175K' not 'exactly $175K.'\n\n**What you DO right now:** Honestly? Not much. You wait for the shares to vest, and when they do, you'll need to decide whether to sell them or hold them. But that's a Year 1 decision, not a today decision.\n\nDoes that help clarify what you're looking at?",

If you also have a large chunk of your savings in your company's stock, you're very concentrated in one place. If something happens to the company, both your income and your savings could be affected.\n\nThat said, some people hold some or all of their shares because they believe in the company's future, and that's okay too. It's not a 'never hold company stock' rule—it's a 'think about concentration risk' principle.\n\n**What influences the decision:**\n- How much other savings/investments do you have?\n- Do you need the cash for something specific (house, kids' education)?\n- How much of your net worth would this represent?\n- How stable is your company/industry?\n\nYou don't need to figure all of this out now. When Year 1 approaches and those first shares vest, we can look at your full picture and make a thoughtful decision together.\n\nYou've gone from 'I feel like an idiot' to 'I want to plan ahead'—that's real progress.

Many people struggle to save anything for emergencies, and you've built a real safety net.\n\nNow let's do the math: If your monthly expenses are $3,500, then:\n- 3 months = $10,500\n- 6 months = $21,000\n- 12 months = $42,000\n\nYou have $28,000, which means you're at **8 months of expenses saved**. That's genuinely strong—better than most Americans.\n\nHere's why the advice varies: 3-6 months is the baseline for people with stable jobs and dual incomes. 6-12 months is for people with variable income, single earners, or high job volatility. As a software engineer with consistent income, 8 months puts you in a very secure position.\n\nMy professional take: You've done the emergency fund work. You can absolutely start directing more money toward retirement and college savings now. That's not abandoning the emergency fund—that's graduating to the next financial priority.\n\nDoes that help clarify where you stand?",

Over 10-15 years, this adds up significantly.\n\n**Priority 3: Keep Some Flexible (10%)**\nMaybe $120/month still goes to your emergency fund or a general savings goal.

Many people struggle to save anything for emergencies, and you've built a real safety net.\n\nNow let's do the math: If your monthly expenses are $3,500, then:\n- 3 months = $10,500\n- 6 months = $21,000\n- 12 months = $42,000\n\nYou have $28,000, which means you're at **8 months of expenses saved**. That's genuinely strong—better than most Americans.\n\nHere's why the advice varies: 3-6 months is the baseline for people with stable jobs and dual incomes. 6-12 months is for people with variable income, single earners, or high job volatility. As a software engineer with consistent income, 8 months puts you in a very secure position.\n\nMy professional take: You've done the emergency fund work. You can absolutely start directing more money toward retirement and college savings now. That's not abandoning the emergency fund—that's graduating to the next financial priority.\n\nDoes that help clarify where you stand?",

Let's fix that.\n\n**Step 1: Maximize your 401(k) first** (Easiest)\nSince you already have a 401(k) at work, start here:\n- Log into your 401(k) portal\n- Increase your contribution to get to $720/month (your 60% target)\n- Make sure you're contributing enough to get any company match\n\nYou don't necessarily need an IRA if you're fully funding your 401(k). IRA is just an additional retirement account option. Focus on the 401(k) first—it's already set up.\n\n**Step 2: Set up a 529 plan** (Slightly more steps, but still straightforward)\nFor 529 plans, you have two main options:\n- **Your state's 529 plan**: Google \"[your state] 529 plan\" - some states give tax deductions for using their plan\n- **Popular providers**: Vanguard, Fidelity, or Schwab all offer 529 plans\n\nYou can open it online in about 15-20 minutes. You'll need:\n- Your kids' Social Security numbers\n- Bank account info for monthly transfers\n- To pick an \"age-based\" investment option (which automatically adjusts as your kids get older)\n\nStart with one kid's 529, then clone it for the second kid. That's your $360-480/month.\n\n**Next step:** Want to start with the 401(k) adjustment first, or do you want to tackle both at once?",

Many people struggle to save anything for emergencies, and you've built a real safety net.\n\nNow let's do the math: If your monthly expenses are $3,500, then:\n- 3 months = $10,500\n- 6 months = $21,000\n- 12 months = $42,000\n\nYou have $28,000, which means you're at **8 months of expenses saved**. That's genuinely strong—better than most Americans.\n\nHere's why the advice varies: 3-6 months is the baseline for people with stable jobs and dual incomes. 6-12 months is for people with variable income, single earners, or high job volatility. As a software engineer with consistent income, 8 months puts you in a very secure position.\n\nMy professional take: You've done the emergency fund work. You can absolutely start directing more money toward retirement and college savings now. That's not abandoning the emergency fund—that's graduating to the next financial priority.\n\nDoes that help clarify where you stand?",

Focusing on what you *have done* rather than what you *haven't yet done* is powerful.\n\nAnd $1,200/month in savings? That's fantastic. You're saving about 10% of your income just toward emergency fund—that's well above average.\n\nFor allocation, here's a framework that works for most people in your situation:\n\n**Priority 1: Retirement (50-60% of your monthly savings)**\nRetirement should generally come before college savings. I know that sounds counterintuitive, but here's why: Your kids can get loans or scholarships for college. You can't get loans for retirement. As they say with the oxygen mask on an airplane—secure your own first.\n\nWith $1,200/month to allocate, that would be $600-720/month to your 401(k) or IRA.\n\n**Priority 2: College Savings (30-40%)**\nThis would be $360-480/month into a 529 plan for your kids. Over 10-15 years, this adds up significantly.\n\n**Priority 3: Keep Some Flexible (10%)**\nMaybe $120/month still goes to your emergency fund or a general savings goal. This gives you breathing room.\n\nThis isn't a rigid rule—it's a starting framework. You can adjust based on your kids' ages, your retirement savings so far, and what feels right for your family.\n\nDoes this allocation feel workable, or would you want to adjust the percentages?",

Totally normal. Most people know they *should* invest but don't know the actual mechanics. Let's fix that.\n\n**Step 1: Maximize your 401(k) first** (Easiest)\nSince you already have a 401(k) at work, start here:\n- Log into your 401(k) portal\n- Increase your contribution to get to $720/month (your 60% target)\n- Make sure you're contributing enough to get any company match\n\nYou don't necessarily need an IRA if you're fully funding your 401(k). IRA is just an additional retirement account option. Focus on the 401(k) first—it's already set up.\n\n**Step 2: Set up a 529 plan** (Slightly more steps, but still straightforward)\nFor 529 plans, you have two main options:\n- **Your state's 529 plan**: Google \"[your state] 529 plan\" - some states give tax deductions for using their plan\n- **Popular providers**: Vanguard, Fidelity, or Schwab all offer 529 plans\n\nYou can open it online in about 15-20 minutes. You'll need:\n- Your kids' Social Security numbers\n- Bank account info for monthly transfers\n- To pick an \"age-based\" investment option (which automatically adjusts as your kids get older)\n\nStart with one kid's 529, then clone it for the second kid. That's your $360-480/month.\n\n**Next step:** Want to start with the 401(k) adjustment first, or do you want to tackle both at once?",

Not to a charity, not to be buried with her—to you and your family. That was intentional. She likely knew you have a growing family and wanted to help you build the life she'd want for you.\n\nUsing inheritance money to improve your family's life—whether that's a bigger home for your growing family, financial security, or paying off debt—isn't disrespecting her memory. For many people, it's actually *honoring* her intention. She gave you this gift to use, not to sit untouched out of guilt.\n\nBefore we talk about the 'what to do with it' question: What kind of person was your grandmother? What did she value?
