There's often guilt about benefiting from someone's death, even when you loved them and they wanted you to have it.\n\nHere's something to consider: Your grandmother chose to leave this money to *you*. Not to a charity, not to be buried with her—to you and your family. That was intentional. She likely knew you have a growing family and wanted to help you build the life she'd want for you.\n\nUsing inheritance money to improve your family's life—whether that's a bigger home for your growing family, financial security, or paying off debt—isn't disrespecting her memory. For many people, it's actually *honoring* her intention. She gave you this gift to use, not to sit untouched out of guilt.\n\nBefore we talk about the 'what to do with it' question: What kind of person was your grandmother? What did she value? That might give you clarity on how to think about this money.",

I never thought about it that way before—that using it for our house would actually be what she'd want. That does make me feel a little better.",

That's not coincidence; that's who she was.\n\nI also want to acknowledge: you said this makes you feel 'a little better,' not completely better. That's completely normal. You can feel grief about losing her *and* feel ready to honor her by using this gift the way she'd want.

Not to a charity, not to be buried with her—to you and your family. That was intentional. She likely knew you have a growing family and wanted to help you build the life she'd want for you.\n\nUsing inheritance money to improve your family's life—whether that's a bigger home for your growing family, financial security, or paying off debt—isn't disrespecting her memory. For many people, it's actually *honoring* her intention. She gave you this gift to use, not to sit untouched out of guilt.\n\nBefore we talk about the 'what to do with it' question: What kind of person was your grandmother? What did she value?

She did this before. For your parents. And now she's doing it for you and your kids. That's not coincidence; that's who she was.\n\nI also want to acknowledge: you said this makes you feel 'a little better,' not completely better. That's completely normal. You can feel grief about losing her *and* feel ready to honor her by using this gift the way she'd want.

Let me break down how down payments work, and you'll see you have some good options.\n\n**Down Payment Basics:**\nMost lenders want at least 5-10% down on a conventional mortgage. The common goal of 20% isn't actually required—it's just the threshold where you avoid PMI (private mortgage insurance, an extra $100-200/month). But with your combined savings and inheritance, you could put down 20% if you wanted.\n\n**For a $475K house (middle of your range), here's what different scenarios look like:**\n- 10% down = $47,500 (you'd have $67,500 left over)\n- 15% down = $71,250 (you'd have $43,750 left over)\n- 20% down = $95,000 (you'd have $20,000 left over)\n\n**My recommendation for your situation:** I'd suggest 15-20% down. Here's why: You have a second child on the way, which means unexpected costs are coming. Putting down 15% ($71K) would leave you with $44K as a buffer for moving costs, nursery setup, and life with two kids. Or you could do 20% ($95K) to avoid PMI and still have $20K in reserve.\n\nEither way, you're in great shape. Most first-time buyers struggle to get to even 10% down, and you're looking at 15-20%. That's real financial stability—exactly what your grandmother would have wanted for your family.\n\nWhat sounds right to you?",

You'll have PMI for a few years, but having that $44K cushion with two kids under five? That's real security. Your grandmother, who valued both practicality and taking care of family, would absolutely approve of that balance.\n\nTalk it through with your wife, and if you have any questions as you move forward—whether about the house buying process, mortgage options, or anything else—don't hesitate to reach out. You've got this, and you're honoring your grandmother's legacy beautifully.\n\nCongratulations on the growing family and the future home.",
