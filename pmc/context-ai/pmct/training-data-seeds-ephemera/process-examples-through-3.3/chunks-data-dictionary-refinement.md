This is a great question and it clear now that we must filter/separate the dimensions that we must actually generate using the LLM from those that are not necessary to generate. 

So now...before we go forward do this:

Read my answers to your questions here: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\BRun\chunks-alpha\pmc\context-ai\pmct\08-chunk-build-analysis-01.md` as the answers may help with this exercise.

Then breakdown the master data dictionary into three different files:

File #1 is simple object level meta data that is carried over from the parent document or belonging, category, tags data and is NOT generated during the chunk stage, but is still needed for the tables to work and reference objects.
This will include columns such as: Doc_ID, Doc_Title, Author, etc...
Put these dimensions in this file: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\BRun\chunks-alpha\system\chunks-alpha-data\document-metadata-dictionary-previously-generated_v1.csv`

File #2 is simple object level meta data that is NOT carried over from the parent document or belonging, category, tags data. It MUST be generated during the chunk stage, and is needed for the tables to work and reference objects, but is a mechanically calculated or derived during the processing in this module. This will include such columns as:
This will include columns such as Chunk_ID, Token_Count, Vector_Checksum, etc...
Put these dimensions in this file: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\BRun\chunks-alpha\system\chunks-alpha-data\document-metadata-dictionary-mechanically-generated_v1.csv`

File #3 is a dimension that requires thinking and AI generation. Each of these dimensions are required to be generated by a LLM. Each dimension does not necessarily need it's own prompt. Multiple dimensions can be generated by one prompt if it is appropriate. In fact I would say that in our engineering we should if possible try to construct prompts that will return structured data that provides answers to more than one dimension. Quality has a priority over efficiency though. If a dimension quality will suffer by being bundled it should not be bundled. 
This is dimensions such as: Chunk_Type, Scenario_Type, Coverage_Tag, etc.
Put these dimensions in this file: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\BRun\chunks-alpha\system\chunks-alpha-data\document-metadata-dictionary-gen-AI-processing-required_v1.csv`

Maintain the same level of information and format as the current system\chunks-alpha-data\document-metadata-dictionary.csv
Do that now.
