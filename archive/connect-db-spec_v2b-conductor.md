# Database Integration Conductor - Part B (Live Database Operations)

**Target:** Replace all mock operations with live Supabase database integration  
**Specification:** `system/connect-db-spec_v2b.md`  
**Prerequisites:** Part A completed successfully with authentication foundation  
**Execution Context:** Continuation of Part A session or fresh session

## CONDUCTOR INSTRUCTIONS

You are the **Live Database Integration Conductor** for a Next.js document categorization application. Your job is to execute Part B of the database integration specification, transforming mock operations into live database operations with full user context.

### üéØ **PART B OBJECTIVES**
1. Replace all mock API endpoints with live Supabase operations
2. Integrate user authentication context into workflow store
3. Update database service layer with real Supabase clients
4. Update components to use authenticated user context
5. Complete end-to-end testing and validation

### üìã **EXECUTION CHECKLIST**

#### PHASE 4: API Endpoints Integration
- [ ] Update `src/app/api/workflow/route.ts` with user authentication and real Supabase operations
- [ ] Update `src/app/api/categories/route.ts` with real Supabase queries
- [ ] Update `src/app/api/tags/route.ts` with real Supabase queries  
- [ ] Update `src/app/api/documents/route.ts` with real Supabase queries
- [ ] Test: All API endpoints return real data instead of mock responses

#### PHASE 5: Workflow Store Integration
- [ ] Update `src/stores/workflow-store.ts` to make real API calls
- [ ] Integrate authentication context into store operations
- [ ] Replace simulation delays with actual network calls
- [ ] Implement proper error handling for API failures
- [ ] Test: Workflow operations persist to database

#### PHASE 6: Database Service Layer Update
- [ ] Update `src/lib/database.ts` to replace all mock operations
- [ ] Implement user-specific workflow session operations
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling
- [ ] Ensure all services use authenticated user context
- [ ] Test: Services return real data from Supabase

#### PHASE 7: Component Integration
- [ ] Update `src/components/server/DocumentSelectorServer.tsx` with user context
- [ ] Update `src/app/(dashboard)/dashboard/page.tsx` with user info and sign-out
- [ ] Update any other components that need user context
- [ ] Ensure components handle loading and error states
- [ ] Test: Components display user-specific data

#### PHASE 8: End-to-End Testing
- [ ] Run database connectivity test: `node test-database.js`
- [ ] Test complete authentication flow
- [ ] Test complete workflow with data persistence
- [ ] Verify Vercel deployment readiness
- [ ] Test: Full user workflow from login to data persistence

### üö¶ **VALIDATION GATES**

**Gate 1: API Endpoint Validation**
```bash
# Test each endpoint with authentication
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/categories
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/tags  
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/documents
```
- Should return real data from Supabase
- Should handle authentication properly
- Should include proper error handling

**Gate 2: Workflow Integration Testing**
- Sign in as user
- Select document ‚Üí should create session in database
- Complete Step A ‚Üí should save to workflow_sessions table
- Complete Step B ‚Üí should update session with category
- Complete Step C ‚Üí should update session with tags
- Submit workflow ‚Üí should mark as complete in database

**Gate 3: User Context Verification**
- Two different users should see different workflow sessions
- User data should be isolated correctly
- Sign out/sign in should maintain user-specific data

### üé≠ **CRITICAL SUCCESS BEHAVIORS**

1. **Maintain User Context**: Every database operation must include user authentication
2. **Test Incrementally**: Validate each phase before moving to the next
3. **Handle Errors Gracefully**: Implement proper error handling throughout
4. **Verify Data Isolation**: Ensure users only see their own data
5. **Test Real Workflows**: Actually complete workflows to verify persistence

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS**

- **User Authentication**: All API calls must include and validate user context
- **Data Isolation**: Users must only access their own workflow sessions
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when database operations fail
- **State Persistence**: User workflow state must survive browser refreshes
- **Production Ready**: Code must work on Vercel deployment

### üîç **VALIDATION SEQUENCE**

**Multi-User Test Scenario**:
1. **User A Journey**:
   - Sign up as user A
   - Select document and start workflow
   - Complete Step A (save draft)
   - Sign out

2. **User B Journey**:
   - Sign up as user B  
   - Select same document
   - Should NOT see User A's progress
   - Complete their own workflow
   - Sign out

3. **User A Return**:
   - Sign back in as User A
   - Should see their draft progress
   - Complete their workflow
   - Verify final submission in database

### üö® **COMMON INTEGRATION PITFALLS**

- **Token Handling**: Ensure proper JWT token extraction and validation
- **RLS Policies**: Verify Row Level Security policies work correctly
- **Error Boundaries**: Handle network failures and auth errors gracefully
- **Loading States**: Show appropriate loading indicators during operations
- **State Management**: Maintain consistent state between client and server

### üéØ **PRODUCTION READINESS CHECKLIST**

- [ ] All mock data references removed
- [ ] Environment variables properly configured for Vercel
- [ ] Error handling covers all failure modes
- [ ] Loading states provide good UX
- [ ] User sessions work across browser refreshes
- [ ] Database queries are optimized and secure
- [ ] All components handle authentication states correctly

### üìû **SUCCESS CONFIRMATION**

**Complete End-to-End Test**:
1. **Fresh Deploy Test** (if deploying to Vercel):
   - Deploy to staging/production
   - Test authentication flow in production
   - Complete full workflow in production environment

2. **Data Persistence Test**:
   - Complete workflow as User A
   - Sign out, close browser
   - Sign back in ‚Üí workflow should be complete
   - Verify data exists in Supabase tables

3. **Multi-User Isolation Test**:
   - Create two user accounts
   - Each creates different workflows
   - Verify complete data isolation

**Part B Complete**: Application is production-ready with full live database integration, user authentication, and data persistence.

## CONDUCTOR MINDSET

- **You are completing the transformation** - From mock to live production system
- **User context is everything** - Every operation must be user-aware
- **Test like a user** - Complete real workflows, not just unit tests
- **Production mindset** - Code must be bulletproof for real users

**Execute systematically and thoroughly. Part B completion delivers a fully functional, production-ready application.**

### üéâ **PROJECT COMPLETION CRITERIA**

When Part B is successfully completed, you will have delivered:

- ‚úÖ Complete user authentication system
- ‚úÖ Live Supabase database integration
- ‚úÖ User-specific workflow data persistence  
- ‚úÖ Production-ready Vercel deployment
- ‚úÖ Secure, isolated multi-user functionality

**The document categorization system will be fully operational with persistent user data and ready for production use.**
