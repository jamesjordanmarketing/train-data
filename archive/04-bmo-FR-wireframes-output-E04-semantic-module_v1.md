=== END PROMPT FR: FR4.1.5 ===

=== SEMANTIC ANALYSIS MODULE IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY ===

## Overview
This wireframe specification implements the complete semantic analysis module as described in the "Business Wisdom Teaching System" design document. The module transforms the traditional technical LoRA training workflow into an intuitive, human-centered experience that enables non-technical business owners to successfully create AI training assets.

## Key Design Transformations
- **Language Translation**: Technical terms transformed to business-friendly alternatives throughout all interfaces
- **Teaching Metaphor**: All interactions framed as "teaching business wisdom" rather than "AI model training"
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Three-tier complexity levels accommodating different user expertise and comfort levels
- **Business Outcome Focus**: All messaging emphasizes competitive advantage and business value rather than technical capabilities

## Implementation Coverage
The five FR prompt sections (FR4.1.1 through FR4.1.5) provide comprehensive wireframe specifications for:

1. **Project Creation & Teaching Journey Start** - Welcoming interface with business-focused value proposition
2. **Knowledge Sharing Interface** - Document upload with business-friendly categorization and AI understanding
3. **AI Understanding Validation & Teaching Lesson Creation** - Validation workflows with expert refinement capabilities
4. **Practice Scenario Generation & Voice Consistency** - Scalable content multiplication with quality control
5. **Final Package Review & Training Data Export** - Completion celebration with business impact visualization

## Success Metrics Alignment
Each wireframe specification directly supports the semantic analysis success criteria:
- **User Understanding**: Non-technical workflow completion without technical support
- **Efficiency Gains**: Sub-4-hour completion with minimal manual interventions
- **Quality Outcomes**: 90%+ voice matching with complete methodology preservation
- **Business Impact**: 100x time savings with measurable competitive advantage

This implementation provides the foundation for building a truly accessible LoRA training platform that democratizes AI customization for small businesses while preserving the technical rigor required for quality training data generation.
