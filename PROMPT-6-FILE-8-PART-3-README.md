Each model displays:
- Context window size (tokens)
- Input/output pricing per 1,000 tokens
- Supported features (text, vision, tool use)

#### Temperature Control (0.0 - 1.0)
Controls randomness in generation:
- **Low (0.0-0.3)**: More deterministic, focused, consistent
- **Medium (0.4-0.7)**: Balanced creativity and consistency
- **High (0.8-1.0)**: More creative, varied, exploratory

**Recommended**: Start with 0.7 for balanced results.

#### Max Output Tokens (1 - 4,096)
Maximum number of tokens in generated responses:
- **Lower values**: Shorter, more concise responses
- **Higher values**: Longer, more detailed responses
- **Default**: 4,096 (maximum allowed)

#### Top P / Nucleus Sampling (0.0 - 1.0)
Alternative sampling method to temperature:
- Controls diversity of word selection
- **Recommended**: Use either Temperature OR Top P, not both
- **Default**: 0.9

#### Streaming
Enable or disable token-by-token response streaming:
- **Enabled**: See responses appear gradually
- **Disabled**: Wait for complete response
- **Recommended**: Disable for batch operations

#### Cost Estimation
Real-time display of:
- Input cost per 1,000 tokens
- Output cost per 1,000 tokens
- Estimated cost per conversation
- Estimated cost for 100 conversations

### 2. Rate Limiting & Retry Tab

Configure API request rates and automatic retry behavior.

#### Rate Limiting

**Requests Per Minute (1-1,000)**
- Maximum API requests allowed per minute
- Prevents throttling from Claude API
- **Recommended**: Start with 50, increase based on your API limits

**Concurrent Requests (1-20)**

#### Retry Strategy

**Max Retries (0-10)**
- Number of retry attempts after initial failure
- **Recommended**: 3 retries for reliability
- Set to 0 to disable retries

**Backoff Strategy**
Choose how delay increases between retries:
- **Exponential (Recommended)**: Delay doubles each retry (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s...)
- **Linear**: Delay increases steadily (1s, 2s, 3s, 4s...)
- **Fixed**: Same delay each retry (1s, 1s, 1s, 1s...)

**Base Delay (100ms - 60s)**
- Initial delay before first retry
- **Default**: 1,000ms (1 second)

**Max Delay (1s - 5min)**
- Maximum delay cap for exponential backoff
- **Default**: 16,000ms (16 seconds)

**Backoff Progression Chart**

### Retry Strategy
- Use exponential backoff (recommended)
- 3 retries covers most transient failures
- 1s base delay, 16s max delay works well

### Cost Management
- Set realistic daily budgets
- Use 50%, 75%, 90% alert thresholds
- Monitor actual spending weekly

### API Keys
- Keep secondary key configured for smooth rotation
- Use quarterly rotation for security
- Never share keys or commit to version control

### Timeouts
- 60s generation timeout for most cases
- Increase for complex content (2-5min)
- Keep total timeout 2x generation timeout
