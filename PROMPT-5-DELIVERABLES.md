- Windows/Linux: `Ctrl` key
- macOS: `Cmd` (⌘) key

---

## Accessibility Features

### Keyboard Navigation
- All interactive elements accessible via keyboard
- Clear focus indicators (ring-2 ring-primary)

## Known Limitations

1. **Number Key View Switching**: Views 2-5 (Templates, Scenarios, etc.) may need to be implemented in the main app router
2. **Export Functionality**: Export modal integration depends on existing export component
3. **Bulk Operations Scale**: Very large selections (1000+) may need batching for optimal performance
4. **Undo Support**: Bulk operations are permanent (no undo)

---

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions
1. **Custom Keyboard Shortcuts**: Allow users to configure their own shortcuts
2. **Bulk Edit Modal**: Edit multiple conversations' metadata at once
3. **Selection History**: Remember previous selections
4. **Smart Selection**: Select by quality score range, status, etc.
5. **Bulk Operations Queue**: Show progress for each conversation during bulk updates
6. **Keyboard Navigation in Detail Modal**: Next/previous conversation with arrow keys
7. **Multi-step Bulk Actions**: Chain multiple actions (e.g., approve + export)

---

## Maintenance Notes

### Code Organization
- All bulk action logic in `BulkActionsToolbar.tsx`
- Keyboard shortcuts split into:
  - Global shortcuts: `use-keyboard-shortcuts.ts`
  - Table navigation: `useTableKeyboardNavigation.ts`
- Confirmation dialog reusable across app

### Error Handling
- All bulk operations wrapped in try-catch
- Toast notifications for user feedback
- Console logging for debugging
- Selections preserved on error

### Performance Optimization
- useMemo for sorted conversations
- useCallback for event handlers
- Event listener cleanup in useEffect
- Minimal re-renders with Zustand selectors
